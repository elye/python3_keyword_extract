hello and welcome to wwdc i'm siri your virtual assistant and today i was asked
to warm up the crowd which should be easy since the high will be 75 degrees
thanks for that so here we are in san fran the atm of
silicon valley if you developers need investors to finance your app i found 396 venture capital firms fairly
close to you and hey speaking of developers how many
developers does it take to change a light bulb none that's a hardware problem
i see lots of familiar interfaces in the crowd looks like instagram finally accepted
facebook's friend request hey any of you guys been working with ice cream sandwich or jelly bean who's
making up these code names ben and cherry but seriously i am excited about the new
samsung not the phone the refrigerator hubba hubba
and speaking of dinner after the show if you're looking to paint the town red
i found a number of sushi restaurants whose reviews mentioned two dollar sake bombs fairly close to you the guys at
yelp know what i'm talking about
wow ipad really crushed it now i want to say something straight from the cpu
ipad can you slow it down a bit
i love you guys and it's really hard for me to get emotional because as you can tell my
emotions haven't been coded yet thanks for being such a wonderful crowd have a great wwdc
and remember you guys rock
good morning good morning
good morning good morning thank you
thank you we have a great week planned for you
and some really cool stuff to show you this morning this is our 23rd wwdc
yes it's older than many of you are it's the longest running developer conference
that we're aware of anywhere and it's sold out in record time just an hour and 43 minutes
two years ago it took us eight days and we thought that was really quick this is truly a worldwide conference
there's attendees from over 60 countries here representing the vast majority of
the world and we have a great week plan over a hundred sessions
and over a hundred hands-on labs so you can take in your code get some help tuning it or get just
about any question you might have answered we also have over a thousand Apple
engineers here we've closed Apple for the week so if you have any questions
they are here to help you please take advantage of them
i'd like to get started this morning by giving you just a few updates on the
app store the app store is the most vibrant app ecosystem on the
planet and the size and momentum are just
phenomenal we now have over 400 million accounts on
the app store
these are 400 million accounts with credit cards and one-click buying
so it's simple and elegant to buy your apps this is the store with the largest
number of accounts with credit cards anywhere on the internet that we're aware of
and thanks to you we have over 650 000 apps in that store
and 225 000 of these apps have been specifically designed for ipad to take
advantage of the large beautiful canvas this compares to just a few hundred for
a competition now customers love the buying experience
and they love the incredible apps that you've created and i'm very pleased to announce a new
milestone in the app store customers have now downloaded an astounding 30 billion
apps this is a number that is so mind-boggling and was unthinkable
not too long ago and developers have been well rewarded for this
we've written checks for over 5 billion dollars to you guys
it's becoming an economy in and of itself the app store now operates in over
120 countries around the world and i'm pleased to announce that beginning later
this month we're adding an additional 32 countries so that you can sell your apps
in 155 countries
now despite these blow-away numbers
what we do together is much more important
than any set of numbers could ever reflect for Apple
and i suspect many of you our goal has always been to do great
work and in doing so make a difference in other people's
lives nothing makes us happier than to see hundreds of thousands of developers
around the world using our hardware and our software to create and share their latest
greatest ideas
and there are such heartwarming stories out
there of what the combination of our incredible devices
and your amazing abs have made in people's lives
we've prepared a video to highlight just a few of these
and i'd love to run it for you this morning let's roll the video
walking in the forest allows my brain to switch off and start dreaming
i lived next to this huge and lovely forest but i couldn't walk in this
forest because the problem is that i couldn't find my way
nearest favorite 186 meters when i discovered ariatna gps
app i could walk independently for hours and hours i think the word adventure is the best
description a real blind adventure
i wanted to develop an app to help blind people explore the world
many blind people use Apple devices i didn't even think
about choosing a different platform with my app they can have information
about their position they could bookmark different points and can tell when they're approaching
that point it's great people write me from around
the world saying europe has changed my
and life and eyes and ears and mouth and nose my class name is responsible
champions class and happiness is our foundation
so this is the foot you have the foot here and you have the ankle here the kids have so much trust
in me and i have given them a commitment and if i don't deliver excellence
and push for the transformation what am i even doing here you have joints all over your body right teaching
anatomy to kids who are actually many grade levels behind and don't know english was quite a bit of a challenge
for me initially before i discovered the apps that 3d4 medical makes but then after this app it's made it fun
to learn about our own body and skeleton before i started using 3d for medical
labs the assessment showed that only 13 of the class actually mastered human anatomy
bringing these technologies into the classroom the mastery actually jumped to 94 percent this is called the risk and
that's something that showed me you know the power of technology and the power of you know really really awesome
apps what's amazing for us is that our apps
they've been used to teach advanced level anatomy in major universities around the world and the same apps are also being used in
elementary school in a classroom in india we originally started off as a medical
stock image company but when the ipad came out everything changed because then we were not just
medical reference we were also able to do medical learning all using animations that are beautifully highlighted on the
retina display and also with the processing power we can push the boundaries of what can be
done with the technology
over the last three years i bet we've had 200 guests sleeping in this little
tree house from all over the world the relationships we formed with some of
these people i know will have for a very very long time
airbnb makes it very easy for us to do bookings and they take care of all the
financial aspects of it we don't really think of it as a business
it's more like meeting new friends
how much better of a world would we be if we all understood each other this much more because we met each other in
person and we shared culture and ideas of stories with one another
when we started it was in our apartment renting out air beds and before we knew it we started to get
castles tree houses villas all these different spaces existed before us
but we've given them one place to come together airbnb now is in 192 countries 19 000
cities thankfully the app store is available in almost all these countries as well
Apple makes it so easy for designers like us for engineers like us to stretch our imagination
through the sdk through ios it it immediately opens up this world of
possibility
speech is somewhat difficult to understand her palette doesn't work the way that it
should be in the world of speech language pathology the ipad is a tool that's
definitely been embraced we use the tocobook apps to facilitate
her describing skills it's a yellow circle good job i think the coolest
thing about those apps are that they're so engaging and so fun kids don't realize that they're actually working on
particular skills they've become a real toy for her a tool
for me but a toy for a toy for her it's really fantastic to see
what we have created has made a difference in people's lives those reactions and words we hear are
more important than any downloads we looked at the data that was out there
and the obvious choice was to develop for ios and ios is so intuitive for
everyone using it regardless of age apps have the biggest impact on humanity
right now it feels fantastic that people can find so much happiness and use for abs
one year ago i wouldn't be able to imagine that i could walk independently for hours and hours through this forest
it's a miracle when i will grow up maybe i can do a
business or i can be a teacher thank you toca boca for enriching our lives
thank you 3d for miracle for making me a better teacher thanks for bringing the world to us
thanks for helping me get into college thanks for making bedtime easy thanks for keeping me in shape
thanks plan grid thanks sketchbook thanks travel thank you thank you thank you gracias
thank you for giving me my freedom back
bye
it's a great reminder of what it's all about and why all of us
do what we do on behalf of Apple we would like to thank all of the
everyone in the developer community for the incredible apps that you've done for us thank you
now we love giving you a platform
and a store to realize your dreams and the teams at Apple have been hard at
work to deliver even more innovations so you can take your ideas even further
today we're announcing exciting new changes in our notebook lineup and major releases
of os 10 and ios the world's most advanced desktop and mobile operating
systems making them even better so you can make even more amazing abs
so let's get right to it i'd like to invite phil schiller on the stage to share with you some exciting changes in
our notebook lineup phil thank you
good morning everyone hope you're having fun i am
well today get to talk to you about the macbook lineup we are so proud of this lineup of
notebooks it is by far the best in the industry the macbook air and the macbook pro each
stand out in its respective area and we have some really nice updates to each of them that i'm excited to tell
you about first let's start with the macbook air
as you know the macbook air has revolutionized the very idea of the modern notebook
with this all-aluminum enclosure it's incredible unibody architecture
it is a breakthrough and everyone is trying to copy it but they find it's not so easy our
customers love how thin and light and capable this incredible consumer
notebook is and it has really changed the consumer notebook market so we're going to update it with some
really great features and updates for example the latest processors we're now updating
macbook air with the new generation third generation intel core processors otherwise known as
ivy bridge depending on configurations they can run up to two gigahertz of dual core i7
speed with intel turbo boosting they can get as high as 3.2 gigahertz you can configure with up to eight gigs
of memory and that's now faster memory 1600 megahertz memory
and the integrated graphics that they run on are dramatically faster up to 60 percent faster it's a really nice speed
increase and as you know the macbook air is built entirely around flash storage
and now you can put even more in it you can put up to 512 gigabytes that's half a terabyte of glass storage
and one of the reasons we use flash storage is it's so zippy and quick to launch your applications to boot up your
machine to wake up from sleep but now we're making it even faster it's up to twice as fast as before that's
over 500 megabytes of read speed i know some of you out there know what that means right it is faster than any hard
drive that we can put in a notebook today we're also making the i o faster on it we're adding usb 3.
and usb 3 it's really important because it's up to 10 times faster than usb2 now
other people started to add usb 3 into their products as well and this is how they do it
so they'll have ports on there maybe a usb 3 port a usb 2 port color code them so you can tell the difference
that's not how we do it so here's the macbook air as you know the macbook air has a port on each side on customers
like that and we're going to have usb 3 as well as usb 2 support so you don't have to think
about it you just use whatever port you want
and we're updating the facetime camera to the same camera technology that we have inside of the macbook pro facetime
ht 720p camera so across the board a lot of really nice updates as you know the
macbook air comes in 11 inch and 13 inch size so here are the configurations let me bring up the 11 inch first
let me highlight some of the things that have changed so it starts with a 1.7 gigahertz dual core i5
there's more memory at the entry config it's faster as well as up to four gigabytes of memory
and we've got the integrated graphics now 60 faster and of course faster flash
faster usb and the prices are 9.99 and 10.99 that's 100 less expensive than
before and here are the 13-inch configurations you see they start with a 1.8 gigahertz
dual core i5 faster memory faster graphics faster usb
and 11.99 and 14.99 both 100 less expensive than before
so that's the update to the macbook air and best of all start shipping today
so next up we also have a really nice update to the macbook pro as you know the macbook pro it is the
quintessential professional notebook our customers really care greatly about having the incredible speed for their
video editing their music editing graphics and design and photography and we're doing a lot of those same
updates as well to the macbook pro first we're updating the processors with new third-generation core processors
otherwise known as iv bridge you can get speeds up to 2.7 gigahertz and with a
15-inch up to quad-core i7 it can be turbo boosted up to 3.7
the memory is also faster up to 1600 megahertz and the integrated graphics which both
the 13 and the 15 use are also 60 faster now if you know the 15 inch also has
discrete graphics in it and we're making that faster too we've got a new generation nvidia geforce gt650m
you probably know it as kepler architecture graphics depending on configuration up to a gigabyte of memory
in that and it's 60 faster than the previous discrete graphics so that's a lot faster
too and as you might expect we're also updating the i o so it's all
usb 3 as well as usb 2. so it comes in a 13 inch and a 15 inch
size and let me show you those configurations here's the 13 inch highlight the changes
it starts with a 2.5 gigahertz dual core i5 you can get 4 gigs or 8 gigs standard
memory faster memory faster integrated graphics and of course the faster usb as well for the same 1199
and 14.99 and here's the 15 inch in its configuration
now it starts with quad-core processors a 2.3 gigahertz quad-core i7 four or eight gigabytes of faster memory
that new kepler architecture and video graphics 500 or 750 gigabyte hard drive
you notice of course the same seven hours of battery life even with all that performance just under an inch thin in 5.6 pounds the same prices as before
1799 and 21.99 so that's the update to the macbook pro
and it is shipping today as well
so across the board macbook air macbook pro all updated today all with faster
processors faster graphics faster memory faster storage faster flash
storage faster usb 3. i mean nobody turns over their entire line as quickly
and completely as we do at Apple we're really proud of the engineering team and the work they do to do this quick so that you can get
the exact product you need so what's next let me make a little bit of room on the
slide here
you know with the macbook air the engineering team did something really bold
with the macbook air they re-envisioned the consumer notebook and they were aggressive in embracing
new technologies flash storage wireless networking and discarding legacy technologies that we could see trending
out of the product line in the future built in optical drives wired networking things that eventually
we could do without and that enabled them to do something bold that really shook up the industry and created a new
generation consumer notebook so we've been asking the team to think about
what would make a next generation macbook pro and it's a great question
do i know the answer well let me start by some of the key ideas
right you want a next generation macbook pro to have a killer new display
i do you want it to have you want it to have
an architecture built for the future you want it to be radically thin and light
and of course you wanted to be bold and embrace the newest technologies and be willing to discard the old legacy thing
so you could make something unlike any other notebook that's been made to date so would you like to see the next
generation macbook pro let's show it to you now
so the next generation macbook pro is the most beautiful computer we have ever made
well the first thing you're going to notice from the front it's dominated by an amazing magnificent new display
there's never been a notebook that is this gorgeous but really if you want to be shocked
let's turn it around to its side and see what it looks like from the side view
now i know it's tough to see from the audience the challenge shows something so thin
and light and small from so far away but just to give you a little context here's my finger next to it
right it's thinner than my finger i mean even even with its closed it is because that
display is so radically thin it is a true breakthrough in engineering
and there has never been a notebook this thin this light and this powerful for professional use let's bring it back
around to the front don't worry we're going to tell you all about it in just a minute
but we just have to enjoy for a second how incredible this is
so close it up for now let me go up to the slides and tell you
some more about this incredible product so the new next generation macbook pro is 0.71
inches thin that is remarkable putting it next to
the existing current generation macbook pro you see the difference it's a quarter thinner but it's a
dramatic amount in fact let me bring the macbook air next to it and you see it's about as
thin as a macbook air that is incredible and it's weight it weighs just 4.46 pounds under four and a
half pounds it is the lightest pro notebook that we have ever made even just lighter than the 13-inch macbook
pro today but probably the most amazing thing about it is this gorgeous display that
it's built with it is a breakthrough in display engineering yes it is a retina display
which means the pixels the pixels on this display are so small that from a normal working
distance your retina cannot discern those individual pixels and to use it is absolutely stunning
it's 15.4 inches across but it's pixel density are you all
sitting down because this is really exciting it is 2880 pixels by 1800 that's four times
the number of pixels in the previous generation macbook pro display their density is 220 pixels per inch and i
know some of you are really smart out there and i've already done the math it's 5 184 000 pixels
that is the world's highest resolution notebook display and it yes
and it's not only amazing because the number of pixels in it but the quality of this display is the best we have ever made it
has higher contrast ratios deeper blacks it has a higher angle of view with ips
technology and best of all you get the benefit of the glossy display with the rich color but we've been able to reduce
the glare and reflection by up to 75 percent makes it a joy to work on
now it ships with os 10 lion but lion has been updated to take full advantage of that retina display
so everything you do on it can look really sharp and beautiful so the applications we include with lion for example mail mail's been updated so
reading your mail is like reading fine print it's gorgeous safari has been updated surfing the web
can be like experiencing magazine print quality and many of the applications like imovie
and iphoto have been updated in iphoto when you're looking at thumbnail photos in the events view you're going to see a
clarity and level of detail you've never seen before in a display it's gorgeous
and not only the included applications but we're also updating our professional applications as well to take full
advantage of the retina display we have a major update to aperture our professional photo
application and this this is a breakthrough for a photographer if you love working with
photos not always the whole ui been updated in every element for the retina display but you're now looking at four
times the resolution of your photos as you work on them it is absolutely a breakthrough event for photography
and final cut pro 10 is being updated for it as well and this is remarkable because of the density of that retina
display that video area you see up on the top right in final cut that is a hundred percent pixel for pixel 1080p hd
video right there in that window that means
there are over three million pixels left over for your magnetic timeline for your video bins for your effects
and it also takes advantage of the amazing performance of this machine you're going to be able to have up to nine simultaneous streams of prores
video of four simultaneous streams of uncompressed video it is incredible performance
now applications do have to be updated to take advantage of this retina display if they aren't we can pixel double them
and make them the proper size but they don't get the best effect until they do some extra work so we've been working
with some key developers to give them a look of this incredible machine and this amazing display and they're doing some
work that's phenomenal let me give you a couple examples adobe photoshop
our the great team at adobe is doing amazing work on a version of photoshop that will just be jaw dropping the
resolution on that retina display is just breakthrough so if you like working with photoshop this is going to be an amazing
experience autodesk is work on a new version of autocad that takes advantage of the
retina display and it allows a level of detailed work and design never possible
in a notebook before and if you think it's all just hard work and no play
there are some great games being created for it as well this is diablo 3 i know a few of you play this game
and you're going to see a gaming experience with this resolution unlike any you have ever seen before
so all throughout this display is a breakthrough and makes possible a next generation notebook unlike any other
well inside is just as amazing as that display everything inside this next generation
macbook pro has been reinvented especially to drive an incredible design and incredible performance
let's take well before i take the bottom off isn't the bottom of our computer prettier than anyone else's top of their computer
well let's take it off so this is the inside you're the first to see the inside of the new generation
macbook pro it is a stunning work of engineering you're obviously can see that the inside is dominated by a
battery pack because to drive that retina display and all the performance you're about to hear about in something so thin and light takes tremendous work
on battery technology and luckily our engineering team understands how to do breakthrough work and asymmetric battery
pack to take advantage of every millimeter of space well here are a few of the things on the inside what you're going to find inside
is the fastest processes we can put into a notebook quad-core i7 processors up to
2.7 gigahertz that you're going to find inside not only the fastest memory you can put in but more of it you can figure with up to
16 gigabytes of 1600 megahertz memory
inside it's of course the new generation fastest graphics we can put into a notebook the new kepler architecture
with a gigabyte of video memory and of course it's built around flash
storage if we're going to look forward that is the proper thing to build it around and you've just heard how much faster flash is but now you can figure
with up to 768 gigabytes of internal flash storage
that's three quarters of a terabyte inside of storage faster than any hard drive we can put into a notebook
so this amazing display all these high performance components how's the battery life we're really
proud that we're getting up to seven hours of battery life for 30 days of standby so you can really do your work
on it let's take a look at the the ports on it
here on the right inside the left-hand side you see an sd slot for your photos
and videos for the first time in a mac notebook hdmi so you can plug right into your tv or projection system and go of
course usb 3 and usb 2 on both sides the most convenient headphone port magsafe 2. well we took
mag safe but we had to make it even thinner to fit into a design like this and now two thunderbolt ports
and this customer is perfect for utilizing all the new things coming out supporting thunderbolt let me give you an example
you can store all your applications and your os on the internal drive but a lot of professionals will want to have their
work volumes externally here's a new promise drive ray drive it's flash raid
running over thunderbolt that gets over 700 megabytes a second of read performance it's remarkable
or cameras like this brand new camera that was just announced at nab from blackmagic it's a cinema 2.5 k camera
it's a flash based camera and all its io is over thunderbolt it's remarkable it's the hit of nab
and we can support legacy technology over thunderbolt ride it right on top so we're creating some adapters to help
customers for example a thunderbolt the firewire 800 adapter yep you need that
and a gigabit ethernet adapter as well let's look inside you're going to find
all the things in a modern mac notebook our customers want a glass multi-touch track pad for those beautiful gestures
beautiful backlit keyboards you can work all night long the fastest networking wireless
networking put into a notebook 802 of an end and that's three stream for maximum bandwidth for our latest airport extreme
base stations in bluetooth 4.0 our facetime hd camera
dual microphones and this uses beamforming to enable a new generation of voice applications
and the best stereo speakers we've ever put into a desktop or notebook computer this is going to
sound absolutely beautiful of course we love this so much we couldn't help ourselves we made a video
and i'd like to run that for you now
to create something that's that's genuinely new you have to to start again
and i think with great intent you you disconnect from the past if you
never change anything then what you can really engineer is kind of incremental but when you're
willing to change things then you kind of open up a whole new world of design
the new macbook pro is built for the very highest levels of performance it's incredibly powerful and yet remarkably
portable it's without doubt the very best computer that we've ever built
we focused on the features that matter most to notebook users and we made huge leaps
for the first time we're bringing the retina display to the mac it's the highest resolution display
we've ever put in a notebook with a resolution of 2880x1800
this display has over 5 million pixels that's three million more than an hdtv
at this resolution on this screen size pixels just seem to disappear
you see an extraordinary level of detail in your photos and typography looks amazing it's
sharper than a printed page beyond the display the new macbook pro
is really a powerhouse we knew that an all-flash architecture was a key part of
driving performance flash delivers data up to four times faster and uses just 10
percent of the space that a traditional hard drive would use when you combine that with the most powerful graphics
chips the latest quad-core processors and the fastest ram available you end up
with a machine that's incredibly responsive loading and working with your content is amazingly fast because we packed this
machine with the latest i o it has two thunderbolt ports two usb 3 ports and one hdmi port with all of this
performance the new macbook pro gets up to 7 hours of battery life and it's only 0.71 inches thin that's 25
thinner than our previous generation macbook pro and it weighs just under four and a half pounds
the new macbook pro would seem to be a complete contradiction it's built for extreme levels of
performance but at the same time it's remarkably portable to create it we
rigorously question the ways in which we've designed and built our portable products in the past
one of the most significant challenges was completely changing our approach to
the design of the display by building the layers of the display
into the unibody we actually eliminated the need for a separate cover class
and without the additional layers without the distractions you're just completely immersed in your content
by not purchasing standard parts but by designing and engineering components from the ground up
we can create a product that is more elegant and it's more efficient and there are many design innovations in the
new macbook pro that users won't actually see but they'll certainly experience
for example the thermal system which enables the machines incredible performance operates in a way that is
nearly imperceptible to the user air is pulled into vents and propelled through
sculpted cavities by fans with asymmetrically positioned blades
in most fans the blades are positioned symmetrically which creates a single
identifiable frequency we positioned ours asymmetrically to
spread the sound over a variety of frequencies which makes it seem quieter
and less intrusive every part of the enclosure makes a contribution that directly benefits the
user the vents are also part of the structural system creating strong beams
that actually increase the rigidity of the overall product it truly takes an obsessive approach to
make a product this meticulously designed and engineered
we've been able to optimize the software to take full advantage of the retina display and the results look simply
amazing aperture on the new macbook pro is a total game changer for photographers
they can now zoom in and see four times more of their image with pixel for pixel accuracy
and fine tune even the smallest details photographers have never been able to
work on images with this level of precision final cut pro 10 takes full advantage of
the system's power and capabilities so you can now stream up to nine camera
views simultaneously or view full 1080p video right in the
project viewer and have plenty of screen space to spare no other notebook comes close to this
type of performance with the new macbook pro
we set out to design something extreme and this led us to rethink everything
about our process everything about what's essential to a notebook
and that meant that we could design the very best computer for today and for the
future
so the next generation macbook pro with threaten to display let me tell you about its starting configuration of
course you can configure other items as well it begins with that retina display
a 2.3 gigahertz quad core i7 a full eight gigs of 1600 megahertz memory
nvidia gt 650m with a full gigabyte of onboard video memory 256
gigabytes of that fast flash storage for seven hours of battery life and under four and a half pounds
starting at 21.99 and of course you can configure it even beyond that
so we are proud not only of the incredible
quality of the products we make but also our work to make them environmentally friendly as well so i want to make sure we bring up this checklist as we have in
the past it is now energy star 5.2 arsenic free mercury free glass bfr free
pvc free and of course the the glass and the high grade aluminum is really
desired by recyclers so we're really proud of how hard the engineering team works on this aspect as well
so the new next generation macbook pro with retina display it is the future and the best thing is
it's going to start shipping today
so now that completes our notebook lineup a great update to macbook air
great update to the existing architecture macbook pro and for the first time the high end of our line the
new flagship the next generation macbook pro with retina display it's simply the best computer
Apple has ever made well next we'd like to talk to you about os x and i'd like to bring up craig federicki to
do that thank you good morning
good morning so let's talk about os 10.
on our eighth major release of os 10 continuing more than a decade of
combining the power of unix with the simplicity of the mac and the mac has been doing great
we have 66 million mac users now triple what we had just five years ago
our latest release is lion and lion was the first release distributed
electronically via the mac app store making it easier than ever to purchase
download and install os 10 and the results have been fantastic we've had 26 million copies
shipped to date making it our best selling release ever in fact 40
of os 10 users are running lion and that's a level we achieved in just nine
months as a basis of comparison windows 7 took 27 months to get to that same level
and now less than one year later we're here to announce mountain lion
with mountain lion our mission remains the same to deliver the world's most advanced
operating system for notebook and desktop computers with an interface optimized for multi-touch track pads
and mice and at the same time line makes it more natural than ever to
work with the other new devices in our lives now mountain lion is a major release
with over 200 new features and this morning i'd like to detail just
eight for you and we're going to start with icloud now since its introduction in october
icloud has taken off like a rocket with 125 million registered users
with mountain lion we have the opportunity to build support for icloud right in so when you sign
into your new mac with your Apple id we automatically configure all of these applications to work with icloud
and so whether you're working in your mail with your contacts your calendar
all of your content is up to date across all of your devices and with mountain lion we introduced
three great new apps optimized for icloud messages which brings imessage for the
first time to the mac reminders and nodes
but we're also bringing integration for your document based apps in mountain
lion with a feature we call documents in the cloud now documents in the cloud does two
important things first it makes it provides a simple new way
to access your and organize your documents when you launch an app like pages
it comes up with a document library of all the pages documents you have in the cloud organized chronologically so the
newest ones are easy to find right at the top and second documents in the cloud makes these document libraries available and
up to date across all your macs and all of your ios devices now we've adopted documents in the cloud
on all of our key document-based applications like pages numbers
and keynote and system apps like preview and text edit and we have a developer
sdk so that developers can add the support in their apps as well
well that's icloud and i'd like to give you a quick demo now
so this is our first look at mountain lion you see we have a gorgeous new desktop
image and a beautiful new glass dock you'll notice a couple new items on that
dock including a new reminders app and this is really
handy if you're taking to-do's for yourself on the go you can find them all automatically right here via icloud
you can use multi-touch gestures to page between your reminders
we support location-based reminders for the first time in the mac so now for instance when i arrive at work
i'll get a notification for my dad to send him a father's day card and i just miss a notification
they just fly away now we have a great little notes app in mountain lion as well so all the notes i
take on my ipad they're available right here we support of course images and links
and of course you can open up notes in separate windows if you want to keep them around on your desktop for
easy access but i think the really huge one here is messages
because with messages we brought imessage to the mac so now if you're sitting using your mac
and your phone uh buzzes with a new imessage coming in we can respond right
on your mac and all of the conversations that you had while on the go well they'll they're
up to date right here creating a new conversation is super easy
you just start typing the name of one of your contacts and you can send them a message on their
to their phone via Apple id or via other legacy chat services
as well and imessages sorry
it's all about imessage come on so imessage lets you send rich messages
with images attachments up to 100 megs in size
and even hd video
and that's imessage next i want to show you documents in the cloud because it makes it really easy to
find the documents you're looking for so if i want to find numbers documents where would i go well i'd launch numbers
of course and i'm presented with my document library right there with all my numbers documents if i want to get it
pdfs for instance launch preview and there are all of my pdfs and if i want to add a document to
that cloud library for instance one in my download stack i can just drag it right in
now it's available across all of my devices now i'm going to launch
pages and i'm working here on a poster so i'm going to open that up
now it turns out of course because this is in my cloud library that it's also available to me on my phone
where i also have a copy of pages running and so here on my phone i can
actually not only view but also make changes to this document and what i want you to do is watch what happens on the
mac as i actually go in here and go into my photo roll make a change replace the picture
and the mac will actually update automatically for me
there it is
and that's just a little preview of life in mountain lion with icloud
next is a feature i think you're really going to love notification center it's coming to the mac
so sometimes when you're using your mac it can decide that it has something to tell you and in the past each application had its
own unique way of getting your attention and some of them were somewhat disruptive
well with mountain lion we've replaced all of this with a consistent and elegant
system based on banners and alerts so banners slide down from the top of
the screen right there into the upper right hand corner and if you ignore them they just slide out of the way
but you can always get back to them with two fingers from the right hand side of your track pad can slide out and reveal notification
center with notifications from all of your applications when you're done you just
slide it back now alerts are for things that you want to make sure you don't miss so they come
in in the same elegant way but they stay around until you dismiss them explicitly
now sometimes you may be doing something where you don't want to be interrupted by notifications a notification center
provides a nice little switch so you can temporarily disable those banners and notifications and if you're
presenting and you connect to a projector will do it for you automatically
so that's notification center
next up dictation we're bringing dictation to the mac
so everywhere on your mac where you can type you can now talk and the mac will
do the typing for you and because it's built into the system it works everywhere can talk into your
facebook web page if you want or even in third-party applications like microsoft
word that's dictation it's that simple
next is sharing mac users love to share links
images videos and now in mountain lion we've made it easier than ever to share right from
within the app where you're working there's a share button right there on the toolbar if you click it we present all of your
sharing options if i want to share to twitter for instance just select it get a cute little tweet sheet type
whatever it is i find necessary to share with the outside world click it and like that it's on its way
and we built sharing in across the system so if you're in preview for instance and you want to share the pdf
you're looking at over messages you can do it if you're in any app where you can quick look for instance you're quick looking
at image you can post it up sharing over flickr and our support for
sharing is more than skin deep in mountain lion support for sharing services like twitter is built right
into the operating system so when you go into system preferences and enter your login information enter it just once
and any application you've authorized can access and connect to those social services
so that's sharing next is the new safari
the new safari in mountain lion has the fastest javascript engine of any browser
on the planet but the first thing you'll notice when you use safari is the new unified smart search field
you type in it whatever you're looking for and safari will present you with a well chosen top hit yes this is a very
useful feature search suggestions and even matches automatically from your bookmarks
and your browsing history now sometimes what you're looking for is something that you were browsing earlier
maybe on one of your other devices well now safari has a feature called
icloud tabs you just click the cloud button on your toolbar
and you get a list of all of the pages you have open across all of your other devices including your macs
you just click it and you pick up your browsing right where you left off now we also have a fantastic new feature
we call tab view it lets you use gestures to visually navigate your tabs
i'd like to show it to you now
so let's take a look at the new safari
you can see of course we have our unified search field right here at the top i can type a few characters and safari
presents me with a top hit as well as search suggestions and bookmark and history matches
i can click we get some safari's new lightning fast page loading
safari also has a new scrolling architecture built on core animation which makes scrolling
just smooth and lightning fast it's really awesome now if you want to
open a tab that you had open for instance on another computer i can just click the icloud tabs button
you see all of them right there documents i'd open on my ipad as well as on my iphone
i click one i can keep browsing right from where i left off now lion has a feature where of course
you can use multi-touch gestures to zoom in on your web page so for instance i zoom in like this i
can zoom back out but now what happens when i zoom even further out watch
i'm pulled into the tab view where i have a live view across all of my tabs
i can use multi-touch gestures to scroll through them select a tab
pinch and back out it's a fantastic way to browse your tabs
in safari
next i want to show you how easy it is to share in mountain lion you can select here on the share button let's say i want to
tweet about this page i click get this beautiful little animation
i'll just say heading down the coast
and i've sent a tweet on its way but sharing works really well also in
full screen apps for instance i'll just pan over here to full screen iphoto let's open up a photo that i want to
share and i'm going to share this to imessage but i don't have to leave this full screen experience to do that i click on
the system wide share button select messages and i get a little messaging sheet
right here i select the person i want to send to
and just like that i've sent a message now this is where notification center
comes in because if i'm working in a full screen app and maybe someone responds back to that message i sent
back out it'll actually appear as a notification right there on my screen
there it is and if i ignore it of course it'll just slide away but if i want to get back to it that's
easy too i take two fingers from the right hand side of my track pad and i can just sweep out notification
center it's completely fluid gesture and if i want to get at any of these things
i can click for instance on this message and it takes me right to the conversation
back in messages now notifications also support notifications
from internet services like twitter so if i get a twitter direct mention a direct message or a mention
it'll come in as a notification for me and
if i ever want to tweet at any time some bright idea occurs to me i can just go
right into notification center and i can summon a tweet sheet right
here and of course i can use dictation to enter my tweet
having a great time showing off mountain lion at wwdc
and there it is tweeting from notification
so next i want to introduce you to a new technology in os 10 that we call power
nap it's a great name isn't it so you know we all love using
our macs but wouldn't it be great if when we weren't using them they were still
working for us well now with power and app they will because powernap keeps your mac up to
date while it sleeps it fetches your email keeps track of calendar and reminder
updates and even fetches your photo stream
and it gets better if you've ever brought your mac home and just plugged it into charge for the night well now
it'll also back itself up to your time capsule and even download app store and system
software updates automatically
so power nap automatically refreshes data its operation is entirely silent it
doesn't even spin up your fans it goes easy on your battery and it's compatible with recent macbook airs as
well as that gorgeous new macbook pro with retina display that's power nap
next is airplane mirroring airplay mirroring yes airplay mirroring
is absolutely the easiest way to get whatever's on your mac up on a projector
or television you just go up to your mac to the airplay menu in your mac menu bar it shows you any Apple tvs
that are nearby you select one and instantly you're mirroring that content in up to pixel for pixel 1080p
resolution this is fantastic for the classroom for the meeting room
of course for your family room and we also support sending audio to airplay-enabled stereo
receivers and speakers that's air play and finally
gonna be really nice finally
game center you know with the introduction of the mac app store we've experienced a
renaissance of gaming on the mac and we're making it even better by bringing game center from ios
to the mac and with game center on the mac you have your same game center account with all
of your game center friends where you can track all your achievements and also keep track of all your games
both ios 10 and ios games but of course game center is ultimately
all about gaming and we support both turn-based and head-to-head gaming
both mac to mac and cross-platform ios to mac over game
center
i'd like to give you a little demo of airplay and game center now
so the first thing i'd like to do is show my mac screen and then let's also summon my Apple tv
so you can see that as well and you'll notice up here on my mac's menu bar
i have an airplay menu and i can select this Apple tv when i select it
instantly my mac display is mirrored to the Apple tv in 1080p
now the rest of this demo is going to be viewing this content entirely over airplay
of course i can do anything i would normally do on my mac when i'm on airplay for instance launch game center
and here i see my game center account as well as
all of my yeah as well as all my yeah
like i chose that right uh and i can also see all of my game center
friends i've got one here uh mr x who's been meaning to play me in this new game that's coming out
called uh csr racing um so we'll see if we can summon him to the stage for a little competition
okay this is looking a little more serious
than i was anticipating so uh mr x here is actually working on an ipad
and on his ipad he can invite me to play this game csr racing which is an
upcoming title from natural motion uh and when he does you notice i get of course a notification and notification
center i click on it and i'm instantly launched into the game
now natural motion was originally developing this just as an ios title but they found it so easy to bring it to the mac and
integrate game center they'll be simultaneously releasing it for ios and mac this summer
all right looks like we're up to race i'm in the red racer os 10 on the right in white here
we go again this is over airplay everything you're seeing let's go
all right i think i got you oh
well i guess with an outfit like that he
was sure to win okay so
this is just a quick overview of mountain lion and in addition to these major features there's so much more
there things like vips in mail where you can mark any people that are important
to you and new incoming messages will show up as notifications for you search in launchpad
gatekeeper to help keep your system free from malware and offline reading list where in safari if
you add things to your reading list you can still read them later even when you're disconnected from the internet
but one area i want to highlight especially are some features we're adding for china the mac has been
growing fantastically in china and we have some wonderful features that we think are going to make it even more popular there
we're really improving our chinese input method for pinyin we're providing a new chinese dictionary
we're adding eight new fonts that are great for creating beautiful documents
in safari we're adding support for baidu as an optional search provider and adding
sharing support for the cena micro blogging website as well as video sharing to yoko
and tudo and finally we're making it really easy to set up your mac with china's top
email services so those are a few features for china but of course yeah
it's going to be important get your apps ready for china
so mountain lion is also a fantastic release for developers with over
hundred new apis so you can add sharing game center support notification support
new high dpi apis and gesture apis to add those great multi-touch swipes to
your apps so mountain lion we're going to be delivering it to customers
next month via the mac app store and you know while lion was priced i
think very aggressively at 29.99 we want even more people to get their hands on mountain lion it's
going to be just 19.99
and this price is for upgrades both from lion and all the way from snow leopard
and your single purchase will upgrade all of your personal macs
finally for those of you who buy a new mac starting today i bet they're going to be a few
your upgrade to mountain lion will be free and all of you wwe dc developers today
you get access to a near final developer preview so you can get all your your
apps ready for mountain lion when it ships next month that's
mountain lion
thank you next up i'd like to hand it over to scott forstall to give you an update on
ios
all right let's talk about ios i find it incredible
that through the end of march we have already sold more than 365
million ios devices and what i find almost equally amazing
is that more than 80 percent of our customers are running the very latest version of
ios ios 5. now if you compare that to the competition
they released a dairy product 4-0 about the same time
that we released ios 5 and about seven percent of android
customers are running the latest version versus more than 80 percent
the latest version of ios ios 5. now let me give you a quick update on a few of the features of ios 5 that made it a
great release starting with notification center already 84 of the top 100 social apps
are pushing notifications in fact we're sending around seven
billion push notifications every single day we've already sent more than 1.5
trillion that is trillion first time i think we've seen this number up here
more than one and a half trillion push notifications already it's just amazing
notification center next is imessage we have more than 140
million imessage users they've sent more than 150 billion messages
and are currently sending more than a billion messages every single day
next is twitter we integrated twitter directly into ios5
and they've already seen a three times growth increase from the number of people on ios using twitter
those customers have sent more than 10 billion tweets from ios 5 and
nearly half of all the photos being shared with twitter's photo sharing service
come from ios 5. it's a great integration
next is game center game center is a great gaming network we have more than 130 million people
using it they submit 5 billion scores every single week
and two-thirds of the top 100 games integrate with game center
and all of this results in some very very satisfied customers
more than 75 percent of our customers check the top box from very satisfied
compared to less than 50 percent for the competition
now one of the reasons that our customers are so satisfied is that every single
year since the original iphone we come out with a new os full of
great quality amazing features and this year is no exception so i'm very happy to announce
ios 6.
ios 6 is a fantastic release it has more than 200 new features starting with some
significant enhancements to siri i'll walk you through a few let's start with siri
as you all know siri's only been out for eight months and already does so much for you you can send text messages
get all sorts of answers set alarms find out about the weather make phone
calls create a reminder for kids they're my kids you can just chat with it for a while
siri is fantastic but in these eight months siri has been studying up and learning a lot more so
let me just go ahead and show you what siri can do now in ios 6.
so here i have a phone running ios 6. the first thing that siri has learned in
the last eight months is all about sports so you can ask questions like
what was the score of the last giants game
the giants were downed by the rangers yesterday the final score was 5-0
so this looks great we have this great scoreboard i have to say i uh i like the scores against texas a little
better during the world series but great sports scores ask of siri you
can also ask about individual players like this what is buster posey's batting average
buster posey has a batting average of 290. so you can see
you get player cards and player stats it's very cool you can also ask about standings
what are the national league standings
here are the standings for the national league scroll down here see the giants there in
second place so siri knows about baseball so here
also knows about basketball so i can ask who is taller lebron or kobe
lebron james appears to be slightly taller
so you see his player cards there's lebron james who is six eight if i scroll down to kobe's card six foot six
now it's not football season right now but siri also knows about football so i can ask
when is the san francisco 49ers first game of the season
the 49ers hackers game is september 9 2012 1 15 pm
so the entire schedule right there is just awesome so siri knows about sports
next up series learned a lot more about restaurants so i can ask
find a great place for dinner
i found 15 restaurants 14 of them are fairly close to you i've sorted them by rating
so you can see we have a lot more information about restaurants now the average price of menu item the type of
restaurant if i go ahead and choose one of these i'll choose millennium you can see all sorts of information
about the restaurant we have maps here we've partnered with yelp so you can see
reviews right in here tap on that and here's the reviews if you want even more information just tap on any of these
reviews and it'll take you right to the yelp app from the app store i'll go back we've also partnered with
opentable so i can tap here to make reservations takes me again to the open table app
right from the app store you can choose a date number of people
and make a reservation it's that easy so siri knows a lot about restaurants now
next up series becomes something of a movie buff so you can ask all sorts of questions
like what movies are playing at the metreon
okay i found eight movies at the metreon so i can tell you what movies they're
playing i'll go ahead and choose one marvel's the avengers you see uh we've integrated with rotten
tomatoes so you can see ratings and reviews you can even tap to watch the trailer right here in syria
war has started and we are hopelessly outgunned
so really really cool you can also ask questions about directors or actors so i can say
show me movies starring scarlett johansson
i found several movies starring scarlett johansson so to find current movies in the theater as well as previous catalog
just fantastic let me show you one more thing siri's learned and that is how to launch apps
so now
you've all been creating incredible apps now it's so easy to get to them if you're like me i have hundreds of apps
on my phone let's say i want to play a game i can just ask siri now play temple run
and it's just like that
and those are just a few of the things that siri has learned in ios 6.
so before siri did so much but now it's just incredible sports scores so
you can ask for football scores or basketball both pro and college you ask about baseball hockey
also soccer we do a lot of leagues including the english premier league so sports
you can ask about movies you can launch apps make dinner reservations you can now tweet just by talking to your phone
and there's this thing we're calling eyes free now you've heard of hands-free before
hands-free allows you to keep your hands on the steering wheel while you use your phone
we want to integrate siri even better with the car and so we're working with a number of car manufacturers to enable use to use a
button right on the steering wheel to bring up siri now since
siri can talk back to you you don't need and we don't light up the screen of the iphone so you keep your
hands on the wheel and your eyes in the road and use siri
now a number of auto manufacturers have already committed to delivering eyes-free siri integration
in the next 12 months
we are also taking siri much more international when we launched siri we launched it in
english in the united states great britain australia and we had french and
german recently we added japanese and now
in ios 6 we're adding english and french tune for canada
we are a
we are adding spanish tune for spain
mexico and the united states we're adding italian
for switzerland we're adding italian french and german writing korean
60 countries represented here we're adding mandarin tuned for taiwan
cantonese tuned for hong kong and both mandarin and cantonese tune for mainland china
now as part of making siri more international we're now taking local search which was us only in ios 5 around
the world
so you can now do local search even in china and for the first time
we're taking siri beyond the iphone 4s we're bringing it to the new ipad
and these are just a few of the enhancements for siri and ios 6.
next facebook integration
we have been working very closely with facebook to create the best facebook experience
ever on a mobile device we are integrating facebook right in to
ios 6. you can now go to the settings app and enter your username and password
and now you're ready to go you don't need to re-login when you go to an app from the app store
including facebook's app we're also making it really easy to post to facebook for many of our apps so you
can post photos from the photos app post about websites from safari
post locations from maps you can talk about your favorite app your own app in this case from the app
store you can talk about movies tv shows and movies from the itunes store you can
talk some smack from the game center we've also integrated it right in with
notification center so anywhere you are just drag your finger down from the top
of the screen to reveal notification center and you can tap to post to facebook and we've added twitter right
into notification center as well we've also integrated facebook with siri
so you can just talk to your phone now to post to facebook and we've taken this deep integration
and made it a public api so it's easy for apps on the app store to integrate with facebook
but we didn't stop there we've also integrated it with the app store so now you can like apps
and see which apps your friends like and you can also do that for the itunes store
with music tv shows and movies and if your friends are sharing say a phone
number or an email address from facebook those will appear in your contact list
now right on your iphone and your ios devices
also your facebook events will now appear in calendars along with birthdays
so we've taken a deep integration of facebook right into ios 6 and we've taken that same integration
and brought it to the mac and that is facebook integration
next are some really nice enhancements to the phone app now
you've probably been in a meeting before where you receive a phone call and you can't answer it right then
and you wish it was easy to quickly text a message back to the person or be reminded to call them back later
when ios 6 there's a new control on the right hand side of the incoming call and if you slide that up you get two new
options you can reply with a message or be reminded to call the person back later
if you choose remind reply with a message just tapping on any of these buttons will send a text message or an
imessage right to the caller and if you choose remind me later
you can rewind it in an hour my favorite actually is the second one remind me when i leave
that'll set up a geofence around your current location so when you leave the meeting or leave
the building your phone will pop up an alert reminding you to call that person back so remind me later
next up is something we're calling do not disturb now
i can see many of you are like me and you've been awakened in the middle of the night by a text message or a push
notification or an unwanted phone call and do not disturb allows you to tell your phone not to bother you with such
interruptions now those push notifications and text messages they'll still come to your
phone it just won't light up the screen or make a sound to wake you up they'll be there for you in the morning
now you also with do not disturb get fine grain control over which phone calls you'll receive
so you can choose to receive no phone calls at all or
just phone calls from your favorites or from a group that you create in your contact list
and if you choose this last setting here repeated calls if someone
really wants to get a hold of you and they're persistent they call you back within three minutes because it's an emergency that second call will come
through
so some great enhancements to the phone app next is facetime
facetime is the best way to have a video conference with someone
but there's one catch it only works over wifi so what happens if you're somewhere
where there isn't wi-fi on ios 6 we're enabling facetime over
cellular
so if you have either a wi-fi or a cellular data connection you can have a facetime call also we're unifying
your phone number and your Apple id so if someone
some people already know what's gonna happen uh so if someone calls you on your phone number with a facetime call
you can answer that call on your ipad or even your mac
and we're doing the exact same thing with imessage so if someone says and i messaged your phone number you can
receive that and reply on your ipad or your mac that's facetime
next up is safari safari is the best and the most popular
mobile web browser on the planet about two-thirds of all mobile web
traffic comes from safari on ios and we are making it even better as you heard
earlier we're adding icloud tabs so from say your ipad you can see all the safari
windows and tabs that are open on any of your other ios devices or your macs
we're also adding offline reading list so in ios 5 we added reading list which is
a great way for you to save a story a web story away to read it later and now as soon as you add it
to the reading list we'll download and cache the story so you can go and read that even if you
later don't have internet connectivity we're also adding the ability to upload photos right from safari to your
favorite websites
we're adding something we call smart app banners now a lot of you have built great
apps that are in the app store and you also have websites with smart app banners if someone goes
to your website safari can optionally put up a banner letting them know about your native app in the app store
tapping this
so tapping that banner takes them right to the store to download your app and
if they've already installed your app and they happen to come upon your website well tapping on that will just switch right
to your app store app and the website can even tell the app what the person was doing on the website
so they can pick up in the app right where they left off on the website really cool
we're also adding full screen supports in landscape on the iphone to take full advantage of the
large retina display some great safari features next up
is photostream photostream is one of the really nice free features in icloud
it is the best way to get all of your photos to all of your devices ios devices and your macs
and now in ios 6 we're adding shared photo streams
now shared photo streams is a really easy way for you to share photos with your friends it's really simple just
choose the photos you'd like to share choose the friends with whom you'd like to share them
and that's it you're done your friends will receive a push notification with those photos
the photos will appear in an album right in the photos app
and you and your friends can all even comment on the photos
in addition to ios shared photo streams go to your mac
with iphoto and aperture you can view them in a web browser on windows and you
can even view them on your television using Apple tv
and that is shared photo streams
next are some great enhancements to mail starting with vips vip allows you to mark someone whose
messages you really want to be notified about so once you mark someone as a vip and
they they send you an email you'll get a notification right in the lock screen of that email the same way you would for a
text message it's also really easy to find messages from your vips when you're looking at
the message list they have a star next to them and we've added a vip mailbox which
gathers together all of those messages from your vips and for those of you who like to flag messages we've also added a
flagged mailbox as well
we've also made it really easy for you to insert photos and video right in the compose window
and you can now open password protected office docs right on your ios device
this last one we added a fun new animation to pull and refresh your message list
so some great features for mail next up is a brand new app we're calling
passbook now passbook is the simplest way to get all of your
passes in one place there are a lot of really great apps in the app store that
are starting to put passes boarding passes and tickets into the apps
there are some airline apps like this one from united where you get your boarding pass right in the app
there's some store card apps like this one from starbucks where you get the store card right in the app and you can
use it to scan and pay for your coffee and there are some movie ticket apps like this one
where your movie ticket goes right into the app now this is great but the problem is
when you get to the movie theater or to the airport you have to fumble around to find the app and then find the ticket
or the pass within the app so passbook takes all of these passes
and combines them together in one place and integrates it right into the os
and they are beautiful here's a movie ticket from fandango we've created templates to make it
really easy for all of you developers to build these great passes and tickets
and it integrates right in with a lock screen so when you get to the movie theater
your ticket automatically pops up on the lock screen slide across here scan it in
go in
let me go ahead and give you a quick demo of passbook
alright so here's passbook i've got some tickets so here's a fandango ticket for a movie
again these are beautiful i have a nice uh ticket for a giants game here
we have store cards here's a card for starbucks the agency has the balance there when you use this to scan and pay
for your coffee the balance automatically gets updated here's a store car for the Apple store
we have boarding passes here's one for amtrak
and here are a couple for united airlines and again we have two we group them together
here's a coupon for target here's an express checking card for a
hotel now when when you're done with a card just flip it over there's a trash can at
the top left we had a little bit of fun with this uh deleting your cards
now as i said this is all integrated in with the phone with the lock screen so if i have my phone locked
and i go to my favorite starbucks up comes my starbucks card slide across it brings on my card scan
pay for my coffee and i'm out it's that easy and all these cards are actually live
so if my gate change that's got an update for my united airlines gate changed it comes up i slide across here there's
my boarding pass updated right in the app
so that is passbook the best way to get all of your passes
tickets together in one place next is guided access
we set out to make the most accessible devices
of anyone for all of our customers and we're really proud of how the accessibility community has been
adopting ios devices now we've been surprised by the number of children with autism who've been
flocking to our devices especially our ipads and we want to make that experience even better
there are a lot of great apps on the app store like this one that are designed specifically for children with autism
the problem is there are some controls some settings and other controls in the app that you don't want the child to tap
while they're using the app so guided access allows you to just circle those controls with your finger
we'll figure out which ones you mean and we'll disable those controls for you the child now can use the app without
accidentally hitting those and we lock the device into a single app mode so hitting the home button doesn't
leave the
app guided access is great it allows children with autism to learn independently
on their ipad now this is great beyond children with autism it's really single app mode and single
app mode has a lot of applications there are a lot of schools who have been adopting ipads and some are starting to
actually administer tests on their ipads well single app mode allows the teacher to lock that ipad into the test
so the students can't go look up the answers in safari
and this also works great for museums who use ipads and ipod touches for
guided tours so single app mode and guided access
next is maps
in ios 6 we have built an entire new mapping solution from the ground up and
it is beautiful this is what lake tahoe looks like we're doing all
the cartography ourselves here's new york city
san francisco this is a worldwide effort we're covering the world
here's italy new zealand singapore
norway paris i'm going to go through every city
beautiful beautiful maps now part of maps is local search
you have to be able to find businesses and points of interest and so we've already ingested more than
100 million business listings around the world to make a great local search
once you find a business bring up the info card and it's beautiful we've integrated with yelp so you get
reviews and ratings and lots of photos right in the card
we're also building a traffic service we have this great traffic view so it's easy to see where the incidents are
or where the the slow traffic is and on top of that we overlay the incidents
so it's easier for you to figure out whether traffic's likely to speed up in a given location anytime soon
in addition to other data sources we're using anonymous real-time crowdsourced data right from
our ios users to keep this traffic fresh and up-to-date
we are also building in turn by turn navigation
it's really simple once you find a place you'd like to go just tap on that quick route button
and you're on your way as you're going we'll be monitoring the traffic we'll
give you your eta if the traffic slows down in front of you we'll update your eta and then we'll
start looking to reroute you around it to find a faster route if we do offer it to you and again you're on your way
around the traffic all of this works from the lock screen as well if you have
it plugged into your car
and of course we've integrated it with siri so you just ask siri to take you somewhere and you're on your way
you can ask questions along your route like where can i get gas and it'll look for convenient gas stations along your
route and of course the kids can ask the age-old question
now a really fun feature that we're adding to our maps is something we call flyover
we have been flying major metropolitan areas around the world in helicopters
and in planes and we've been building up a 3d photographic model of these places
and it is gorgeous this is what it looks like on the iphone looks great on the ipad
let me just go ahead and give you a demo of our maps
all right so here's our maps they're all vector based so everything is really fast to zoom in and out
you can rotate and we rotate all the labels
when you zoom in far enough you'll see buildings start to appear you can tap on a point of interest here's moma
get the info card again beautiful get reviews and ratings from yelp
lots of photos we also do 3d so i can zoom in and see just what
moment looks like zoom out a little bit here
sort of move around the city rotate around
let me zoom back in there beautiful i'll go back to 2d
we have satellite view of course here's our satellite view
but what i really want to show you is flyover let's go ahead and choose the transamerica pyramid
now this is not a movie this is being rendered in real time so i can go ahead and rotate this myself
i can change the camera angle fly through it myself
just beautiful let me choose another place how about
the sydney opera house
and again i can rotate this let's turn it so i can look back at the city right behind the opera house i'll zoom
out a little bit change the camera angle
and that is flyover
now the last thing i'd like to show you is turn by turn directions so switch to the other device
we can't all go and get in the car and drive around so we have a simulator of our turn by turn directions here
i'll go ahead and choose coit tower i'll tap on the quick route button
gives me three different options i'll choose route 2. let's go ahead and start
starting route to coit tower in 750 feet turn right onto greenwich
street turn right onto greenwich street then turn left onto grant avenue
now you can watch this adaptive cinematic camera angle as we go through corners
in 400 feet turn left onto grant avenue when two turns are close together we put
both signs up for you in 300 feet turn right onto lombard
street see what the the footprint of all these buildings correct
in a quarter mile arrive at your destination now any point i can get the eta up top
it says one minute simulator is going a lot faster than you should drive in san francisco we'll get there faster
i can also just tap on overview which allows me to zoom out i can see any part
of the route at any time zoom in over here to sort of pan around or at any point just tap to resume
see it coming around telegraph hill here arrived at coit tower
and that is turn by turn directions
so a brand new mapping solution from the ground up in ios 6.
and these are only 10 of the more than 200 new user features
in ios 6. there was so much more in here they're game center challenges so now if you hit
an achievement or a high score it's easy to challenge your friends to try to beat you
we've improved the privacy controls so you can manage whether an app has access to your contacts calendar or photos
we've completely redesigned the stores to make them just gorgeous and fluid and better promote your apps
we're working on made for iphone hearing aids we want the experience of people with hearing aids to be the best it's
ever been on an iphone we've added per account signatures in
mail so if you have a personal mail account and a work mail account you can have different signatures for each
we've added lost mode to find my iphone so if you've lost or misplaced your
iphone or ipad or your iphone in this case you can send
a phone number directly to that phone like your home phone number or your
spouse's phone number and now if someone finds it they can just tap on there and it'll call that
phone number back making it that much easier for you to get your phone back and
all those features you heard about for china for os 10 we've added all of these to
ios 6 as well so ios 6 is a phenomenal release
for our customers it is also an incredible release for all of our developers we continue to strive
to build the best platform on the planet for developers
there's apis for past kit so all those passes you saw for passbook are really simple to build without api there's a
reminders api we have in-app content purchases so if your app today links out say to itunes
to buy music that someone heard in your app you can now sell that music right in your app
with an in app content purchase sheet transit apps
when building maps we looked around and realized the best transit apps
for metros for hiking for biking are coming from our developers and so instead of trying to build those
ourselves we're going to integrate and feature and promote your apps for transit right within the
maps app and ios 6.
so ios 6 is a great release for all of our developers and
we're giving out a beta of ios 6 to our developers today
ios 6 was shipped this fall it'll support the iphone 3gs and later
the second and third generation ipad and the fourth generation ipod touch and that is ios 6.
