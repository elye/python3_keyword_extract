thank you I'm really glad you like that those
words mean a great deal to us and you'll see that reflected throughout the show today
welcome to the Worldwide Developers Conference you're going to have an incredible week this is our 24th WWDC
it's the longest-running developer conference that we're aware of it's truly worldwide we have attendees
this morning for over 60 countries and two-thirds of the people in the audience today are here for the first time
no hazing from the upperclassmen we've got a great week planned for you with
over a hundred sessions and over a hundred and twenty hands-on labs so you can bring in your code
get some help tuning it or get just about any question answered we also have
over a thousand engineers here this week so grab them make use of them they're here to help but don't ask them about
future roadmaps now the developer program is incredibly
vibrant we have over six million registered developers with one and a
half million of those added in the last year alone demand for this show has never been
greater we sold out in just over a minute I'm really sorry we couldn't
accommodate everyone it's the biggest venue that we can get but we are posting sessions online every
day so that developers can follow us remotely I'd like to get started this morning with a few updates beginning
with Apple Retail of course our retail stores are the best place to discover
and explore our products and over a million people per day did that last
year this is phenomenal our stores are filled with our colleagues who work at
our stores because they're passionate about how Apple technology can enrich people's lives our stores have become
integral parts of the communities that they serve tens of thousands of school kids pick their local Apple store as the
destination for their annual field trip and millions of customers come to our
stores for personal training so that they can learn to get the most out of their Apple products we now have 407
stores around the world we're operating in 14 countries and we've recently opened this beautiful store in Berlin it
is really awesome it's in a 100 year old building it was originally one of the
first theaters in Berlin we painstakingly honored the history of
the building by restoring the facade and the original theater and added some
classic apple touches along the way the theater is integral to the building but
separate from the store and will be hosting many events throughout the year for the communities from music to films
and more we had our signature crowds at the opening and we were so excited about
this opening we made a video and I'd like to run it for you this morning
[Music]
[Music] [Applause]
[Music] [Applause] [Music]
[Applause] [Music]
[Applause] [Music] [Applause]
[Music]
that's Berlin it's a fantastic store in a great location only Apple to do this
now we also have some pretty great digital stores and I know this is
incredibly important to those of you in the audience the app store celebrates its fifth birthday next month nothing
like the app store existed before and it has fundamentally changed the world
customers love the buying experience and they love your incredible apps and
they've now downloaded 50 billion apps this is phenomenal that's a lot of zeros
and a truly staggering number for less than five years thanks to you we now
have 900,000 apps in the store and the catalog is very active 90% of those are
downloaded each month we have three hundred and seventy-five thousand apps that have been designed for iPad to take
advantage of the full beautiful canvas that still compares to just a few hundred from those other guys and we
have five hundred and seventy-five million accounts these are most of these
accounts have credit cards and one-click buying so it's simple and elegant to buy your apps we have more accounts with
credit cards than any store on the internet that we're aware of now we are
incredibly proud this morning to announce that we have now paid
developers ten billion dollars
and the momentum is incredible we paid out five billion of that just in the last year now to put that in context
that's three times more than all other platforms combined one of the things we
love about the App Store is that it levels the playing field between large
developers and small developers Ron Conway said it very nicely the App Store
in the iOS ecosystem give budding developers with great ideas the best
chance for success this morning I'd like to introduce you to on key on key is
using the iOS platform to create an entirely new category of experiences
they're launching their company for the first time on stage today they're using
iOS devices and the iOS platform to bring artificial intelligence and
robotics into our daily lives I'd like to introduce Boris Othman CEO and
co-founder of Augie to tell us about his company and their very first new product Boris
we started Anki while working on our PhD in robotics at carnegie mellon university where we worked on everything
from machine learning to walk in robots to autonomous vehicles with the help of iOS devices we are bringing these
robotics and artificial intelligence technologies out of the lab and into people's lives and we're starting by
reinventing the way people play today after over half a decade of working on
Anki we are so excited to give you a peek at our first product on key drive
assisting me today is Brad Newman our lead a re-engineer a donkey now we're
going to start by sharing some the technology under the hood as we have these cars go through a few formations realize that each of them is completely
driving themselves and our app is coordinating the entire experience over Bluetooth Low Energy the cars can
control their speed and a steer around the track by doing the same computations your brain does when you drive they sense where they're located and
they react to their surroundings all in real time this red car he's our hero
a we designed him and all the other cars to be incredibly smart 500 times per
second they're running logic descends to track their position on it adjusting their steering and speed and communicating back and forth with our AI
engine I got iPhone now all it Aiden join his friends and tell me hit the gas watch this wait restart yep one second
yep good
all right here we go
and mm-hmm all right then we're good to
go yep
alright here's a little camera-shy
and joining us friends there we go all right
so that's 18 weeks to the pack our app
knows everything that's happening in real time it's analyzing thousands of potential actions every single second
and not just for Aiden but for every single car we are using iOS devices not just as remote controls but is the
brains behind an immersive real-world experience and that is what lets us bring these cars to life now let's do
something interesting here Brad he's going to tell these other cars to try to block Aiden and just to be clear none of
this is choreographed all we're doing is defining a new objective for each car and they figure out the rest here Aiden
he's using the exact same logic he was using before sensing where he is and reacting to the other cars as he looks
for an opening except now these other guys are on a mission to try to block him luckily
luckily aiden is equipped to handle any situation this is a video
this is a video game in the real world we can customize everything in software from the characteristics of the vehicles
to the weapons that they can use we are taking all of the things we love about video games and programming them onto
physical characters you can actually touch with Anki Drive we use a technology to take gaming to a whole new
level and the real fun starts when you take control of these cars ourselves with your iPhone or iPod touch you can
play against your friends or you can challenge take your chances against the AI we are bringing video games to life
on the floor of your living room keep your eyes out for Anki Drive coming to Apple stores
and Apple online this fall and we just pushed the Anki Drive out today so you can download it and get a deeper
look we are a robotics and artificial intelligence company and what you see here is only the beginning thank you
very much
it's incredibly fun I think these guys are gonna be super successful I think it's a great example of the power of the
combination of your incredible apps and the iOS devices in the ecosystem I'd
love to show you a lot more today but we don't have time but I'd like to think on behalf of Apple I'd like to thank all of
the developers here for making such incredible apps thank you
next I'd like to talk about the Mac the Mac install base now is incredibly
strong at 72 million this is double what it was just five years ago we announced
the new iMac at the end of last year and it went on to become the number one
desktop in the US and the MacBook has continued to define the future of the
notebook it is the number one notebook in the u.s. in fact the Mac business has
outpaced the PC business for several years now and if you look at the last five years the average annual growth
rate isn't even close and if you look at the total growth over that period of
time the Mac is up a hundred percent versus the PC a paltry 18%
now for us it's never been about making the most we care much more that the Mac
is number one in customer satisfied
users are using the latest version of using our using mountain lion
now that compares to Windows 8 which is kind of struggling to get to 5 we're
making the best Mac's we've ever made but we're not standing still we've got
lots of innovation left and today we want to talk to you about what we're
doing with OS 10 to do that I'd like to invite Craig federighi up to the stage
you're too kind good morning let's talk about OS 10 our latest release mountain
lion is the ninth of our big cat named releases in just over a decade as we
turn our attention now toward the tenth we've hit a real issue we do not want to
be the first software in history to be delayed due to a dwindling supply of
cats now fortunately we do have a
creative group at Apple and we can think out of the box and so we thought maybe
we could take this lion thing in a different direction so I'm proud to present to you today
OS 10 sea lion
okay maybe not that could be a bit of a dead end so in fact we're really excited
about the future of the Mac and we want to set a names that are gonna carry us for at least the next 10 years and you
know the answer really was really obvious to us it's those places that inspire us here in California in the
place where OS 10 is designed and built
so for our first California themed release we went just outside our back
yard just off the coast to a place with some of the biggest waves and most
extreme surfing in all of North America OS 10
now Mavericks is a release with deep technology focused on extending battery
life and providing responsiveness it has great new apps and enhancements
for every Mac user and some features that we think are gonna really appeal to our power users and I want to talk about
just three of them right now starting with finder tabs it sounds like
you guys know how this is gonna work so you of course can work in the finder with multiple windows it's a very
powerful tool but now you can draw all those windows together in tabs and each tab can have its own location its own
View mode it's really powerful too you can actually drag contents and hover across tabs and of course now that we
have tabs in the finder it's also a great app to take fullscreen next
tagging yes that guy
we're bringing tagging to the Mac so now when you save a document in addition to
providing its location and name you can tag it and when you do it'll appear right in the Finder sidebar and in fact
you can tag things wherever they are whether they're an iCloud or on a local file share and all those will be brought
together and appear in finder and tags are great for really powerful search as
well next ya next multiple display
good Mac of course we're not giving you all the free multiple display here software so with multiple displays and
the Mac it's always been a powerful way to spread out your work but now in Mavericks you can get at your menus
across multiple displays you can summon your doc across multiple displays and
when you take a window full screen on one display it doesn't mess with your desktop on the other display
and I really love this when you pan your spaces you can do it independently on
each of your displays finally if you
have an airplay connected HDTV it acts as a full power separate display as well
and I'd like to show all of this to you
alright let's take our first look here at Mavericks and we're gonna start with
the finder so here's a finder environment I got a lot going on a lot
of Windows a lot of different locations I'm going to go up here to the window menu and let's merge all my windows just
like that hop into a set of tabs now of course these tabs at different locations
different view settings for each of those locations creating a tab is just to choose it you'd expect just click
plus I can select another location like airdrop maybe another for this work file
share I have going right here and now that I have multiple tabs it's a really
great way to actually work and copy document so if I want to copy this field report I can just hover over the airdrop
tab drop it just like that really nice and of course I can now take finder
fullscreen next let's take a look at tagging this is really cool
so as I go to save a document you notice I can give it a name like let's say project plan and in addition to its
location in this case I'm gonna save it in iCloud I can also give it a tag from any of the tags I've made up so I'm
gonna call this document important looks pretty important to me and we'll go here into the finder and you see in the
Finder sidebar I have an important tag and I see all these documents there from different locations different applications all drawn together in
sidebar we have other tags I've given things for things that are draft and in review now of course with tags I can
assign multiple tags to the same document that's part of the power of tags so I go here and I'm gonna say this
one is also in review and you notice as I sign that tag it now appears in that location as well and if I want to assign
a totally new tag on a makeup a tag on the fly can just type it right here there's a website project I'm working on
it says create new tag website and just like that I've created a new tag and you
can see it right here in the finder I can give that tag a color of course and
now that I have that tag I can also assign tags by just dragging things in
to the tagger area in the finder so different assets from my website just drag them in and they're tagged like
that and tags are great for searching so if I start typing let's say important
you can find all documents that are important let's go to all my files and we'll find all documents that are both
important and that are in review and just like that I found exactly what I'm
looking for with tags
next let's take a look at multiple displays I'm gonna open up some of the kind of windows that I'm often working
with will open up iPhoto here may be a keynote presentation and I actually have a second display connected to this
MacBook Pro let's show that up there on the display now of course with multiple displays I can just move windows across
this place like you'd expect but now I can get up at my menu bar and the second display if I go down to the bottom I can
summon the dock just like that if I want to open an app on the second display I can just open it on the dock here and
here's iTunes take this app full screen just like that and as I swipe spaces
just right back there just on that display let's take a keynote full screen as well I'm gonna go back to my first
display here let's even take iPhoto fullscreen so now I have different full screen apps on my different displays
it's actually a really fantastic way to work going here in the favorite travels and I can now drag assets across my full
screen apps like that supercool and Mission Control has just been
supercharged for multiple displays so I'm gonna go now into Mission Control and we see my different fullscreen
spaces and desktops across applications I can drag a window from one display to
another but I can also go and drag a full screen app right across displays
bring preview open and now I have that full screen on this display as well
finally I actually have an Apple TV around here let's bring that into play so here's my here's my Apple TV now this
is this is pretty over the top so I can actually go here into airplay I'm going
to connect to this Apple TV so now it's a full power display as well you can see
I have my menu bar and my dock I can go over here and get my dock here and I can
go into Mission Control even and I can go get a window across that other
display we'll just drag keynote over here right on to my Apple TV and open it
up there it is full displays in Mavericks
next I'd like to talk about some advanced technologies in Mavericks you
know our power users are increasingly doing their work on the go they want great responsiveness but they also want
great battery life and in Mavericks we've introduced a whole host of technologies to address that challenge
things like compress memory that make sure you have memory available very quickly when apps demand it technologies
like app nap that actually make sure we're directing power only to those applications where you're really
benefiting from it system-wide core animation accelerated scrolling and OpenGL 4 for super responsive graphics
and topic I want to go into in a bit more detail now timer coalescing so you
know when you look at battery life on your computer the real factor that software has the most influence over is
CPU activity and it's draw on power and if you look at what your system is doing at any given time what you'll see if you
look under the hood is not a smooth line but actually hundreds of interrupts occurring per second where the system is
going from a power efficient sleep state up to a state of high power use and back
down and all of those transitions actually consume a lot of power well in Mavericks we intelligently align all of
that work reducing those number of transitions this in combination with technologies like app nap and other
power optimizations reduce CPU utilization activity for these kinds of
scenarios up to 72% it's pretty awesome [Applause]
next let's talk about compress memory nothing affects the performance of your
Mac the responsive it's more of a Mac that's under load then its ability to provide free memory to an app now
typically when you look at your app runtime all your memory isn't active in fact a subset of your memories actively
being used and others this memory we have to keep around but isn't being used by the app well now if you open a
document your system is going to need to get free memory and it does that in the past by writing those inactive bits of
memory out to disk and that's a slow process now with compressed memory we're
able to rapidly compress the inactive memory making free space available almost instantaneously to the
application this can have great effects on responsiveness of systems under load you see 1.4 X kinds of improvements even
on fast SSD systems for activities like opening new documents or reactivating an application and up to 1.5 X improvement
for waking a system from standby these are just two of many improvements to
power and performance in Mavericks next let's talk about Safari in the last
decade of life Safari has focused not just on providing the easiest to use the
most elegant browsing experience but also the most innovative these are the
kinds of innovations that Safari is broad private browsing blocking of third-party cookies for privacy making
the web easier to read with features like reading list and the html5 audio and video tag all Safari firsts and the
engine and Safari WebKit is used by over 1.5 billion devices well in mountain
lion we're making Safari even better we have a great clean new homepage with top
sites from there you can get at a great sidebar where you have access to all of
your bookmarks and you can browse right from your bookmarks and in that sidebar
we also have reading lists where now you can continuously scroll through your articles moving from article to article
without ever having to click and a great new feature called us shared links where you see all
of the links shared by people you're following on Twitter and LinkedIn you can browse them right here now in
addition to these and user improvements there's also a lot going on under the
hood big improvements to JavaScript a full process per tab architecture and
memory efficient is the improvements with shared memory resource cache and a whole bunch of big power savings as well
when you look at the effects of these changes it's pretty profound if you take a synthetic benchmark like SunSpider
you see how Safari fares against the competition but you know researchers
have started to look at more real-world JavaScript by sampling the JavaScript that actually occurs on sites like the
Google homepage Facebook amazon.com and when you look at safaris performance on
a benchmark like that j/s bench the results are really incredible [Applause]
safari is also awesome when it comes now to memory usage using way less memory
than the other browsers which means more memory for you to browse with more tabs and do more on your system and when it
comes to energy use it's not even close Safari uses way less energy than Chrome
and when you compare to Firefox it's just kind of sad so that's Safari I'd love to give you a
demo of some of our advanced technologies in Safari right now so
let's start with responsiveness and I'm gonna go now into mail and so here we
have a mailbox with about a hundred thousand messages in your your inbox and I just want to show you how how you
scroll now with that accelerated scrolling perfectly smooth incredibly fast almost 60 frames a second whenever
you do it it's just epic and when you look here at scrolling through a conversation this is a conversation with
26 messages in it again just super glassy smooth super fast it's really
really nice let's take a look at that in Safari in Safari we've improved scrolling for more popular websites and
actually optimized heavily for Retina displays so now it's just super fast
super smooth now let's take a look at power yeah there's a fan of smooth
scrolling right there in the front I'm a fan of smooth scrolling as well so let's
take a look at power usage you have a power meter up here that's showing CPU activity in Safari and you notice right now it's quite low cuz we're not doing
anything but let's go into a website that's going to use a lot of power and you notice the power meter shoot right
up because we're doing a lot of animation here using a lot of CPU and that's ok that's what the CPUs for it's doing something cool for me right here
but very often you'll have something like this happening in an ad off in the corner you've covered this window up and
yet it's still draining your battery life you don't even realize it well now with this technology we call app nap we
keep track of what's going on and what things you actually see to decide where to direct power so watch what happens
when I bring up this iTunes window over the Safari window power drops right now that's
extending your battery life but of course that thing is still running it's
still available to me so if I pull it aside there it goes you can see everything happening right now the power
goes up cover back up power goes right back down it's really gonna have to help
your battery life next let's take a look
at the new Safari top sights really clean really nice we'll bring out the
new sidebar you see I have all my bookmarks here I have my bookmark folders as well if I want to bring a
site over for my bookmarks into top sites I can just drag it out like this it's really nice I can open it up
animates in from the sidebar we also have access to our shared links so you
see sites that I'm following here on Twitter and LinkedIn you can click on a link that's been shared loads it up I
can even retweet it right here if I if I wish and we now have one-click bookmarking so I'll just click this plus
it's gonna hop right in to my reading list right there let's go take a look at my reading list see all the the articles
I've added here to my reading list I want you to watch how scrolling works because now when I scroll and I'm
reading through one article read this this is great really enjoying it get to the bottom there's the next article I
can just scroll right through to the next article just like that awesome
we also have a beautiful new look for reader here's reader and I'm going to bring up
my I can actually close up my my sidebar here and now as I scroll reading and I
just want to read from one article to the next it's just like that super clean and super nice and that's Safari in
Mavericks I think you're gonna like
so we have some more improvements that I think are going to really help you with your browsing and one of them is iCloud
keychain you know to really be secure
these days you want to have a different complex password for every site where you have a login but this inevitably
brings up the question what's my password and these solutions are not recommended there is a better way with
iCloud keychain we can remember your website logins your credit card numbers even your Wi-Fi networks and they're
always encrypted synced across all of your systems so they're always available to you now when you go sign up for a
website you can of course enter your own password and will remember it but as well Safari can auto suggest a password
for you you don't have to remember that but it'll enter it in for you and then sync it across all of your systems and
log in for you from then on
iCloud keychain is great for your shopping as well when you come to a credit card field you can suggest any of
your remembered credit cards select one and I'll just enter it in for you just like that along with your expiration
date but you have to remember your own security code that's what makes it secure after all and that's iCloud keychain
[Applause] next some improvements to notifications
so now with notifications on the Mac if you're a Californian like me you'll
often get this kind of notification hey want to go surf these 30-foot waves and your response surely is to mouse over
the notification and immediately write their reply yeah sure I'm going to surf that 30 foot way you can reply right
inside the notification and you can do this for things like email and quickly delete email you might not want to deal
with without even having to go to mail if you get a FaceTime call you can respond saying hey I'm gonna call you
later or remind without having to pick up the call it's really handy we also handle a new kind of notification so if
you have an app today that sends push notifications to iOS devices well now you can sign up to
receive those push notifications on your Mac as well whether Safari is running or not so things like your fantasy football
alert maybe breaking news news about
that buy on eBay and now in Mavericks
when your machine is sleeping when you wake it up it'll tell you everything that you missed while your way right on
the lock screen and it'll now update apps for you right in the background so
you don't have to do it yourself
so that's notifications next up calendar
let's take a look absolutely no virtual
cows were harmed in the making of this user we're gonna be adding that one to
our environmental checklist justice so in addition to that you have your
Facebook events right on your calendar if you wish and we have a great new inspector that's even aware of things
like location travel time and weather and that's the calendar next Maps
the Maps team has been making great improvements to the data and maps and Mac users are going to benefit because
we have this fantastic new Maps app of course with your street maps you have your 3d beautiful flyover data search
for points of interest great info cards you can get turn-by-turn directions and
my favorite part when I have a route that I've set up on my Mac and now it's
time to go you can just click right up here and send it right to my iPhone
where they'll appear right on my lock screen
and when I unlocked my phone takes me straight into navigation supercooled we're also providing a developer SDK so
you can add mapping functionality to your apps as well so that's Maps finally
we're bringing iBooks to the Mac so now
you have access to the full library of 1.8 million books in the iBook store
your full library from your iOS devices is available on your Mac as well it's a
great environment for reading it's also a great environment for taking notes and it supports iBooks textbooks they're
beautiful and they're interactive I'd love to give you a demo of all of this right now
so let's start in maps so here we are in
Paris you can just zoom in to be some comparison can zoom right in you see
it's just so fast and fluid bringing in points of location I could pan around the map find a nice location maybe the
Eiffel Tower right here let's go into look at that flyover data so we can see
the Eiffel Tower can go in to tilt it over the Eiffel Tower right there
flyover data is just beautiful and of course I can even rotate around Paris
look you can even see through the Eiffel Tower as it rotates into the area of the city below the data is just gorgeous
then you fly over data it's really amazing on your Big Mac display of
course we support great search for points of interest so if I want to go to lunch maybe yet I'm told this is East Savoie will go to g-sib la we have these
great info cards with reviews photos I can add a site to my bookmarks just like
this and it's now synced across all my devices so this location is available to
me course on my phone because this is a Mac I can tear these off so if I'm planning a trip I can set aside some
things of interest I can of course get directions let's do that here directions from the Eiffel Tower and when I'm ready
to go I can send it right to my phone like this and that's mass
next let's take a look at the new calendar has continuous scrolling and
what's really amazing is even without the stitching the window still sticks right there on the screen it doesn't
fall off about the stitching it's engineering it's really great for
creating events so if I go and create an event like this let's say I'm gonna have lunch and I'm gonna type in what I would
I want to have for lunch so I'm gonna say I want pizza and you notice it suggests all sorts of locations nearby
so I'm going to select Tony's Pizza and you notice I get a map I even get
projected weather for that location so I know if I need to bring a jacket now I
can select here and actually ask it to tell me what the travel time is expected
from my last location so I can decide if I want to drive or walk I'm going to say I want to walk and it actually adds the
travel time right to my calendar so I know not to schedule anything
and I don't have to remember because I can ask to be notified when I need to
leave and I'll get a notification both my Mac and on my phone as well so that is maps
finally let's take a look at I book so I have all my books here of course can
browse my color collections I've arranged we have access to the store with all of its content books of course
it's ultimately about reading so you can get in here and read move easily between
the pages you have access to all the controls you'd expect your bookmark search can adjust your type of font and
type size go into a nice night mode that's relaxing for the eyes but of
course I really love these interactive iBooks textbooks let's open one of those
up now so I can scroll through the pages in my book see all these nice
Interactive's and videos I can pinch right into a graphical table of contents scroll through the pages of this chapter
you can select another chapter scroll through just like this are these
fantastic Interactive's so if I want to understand the way the cellular structure works for instance on this
leaf you can just drill right in see all the way through this it's just
incredible really great way to learn
it's also a great environment for taking notes and just select some text add a
note ask the teacher about this take a
note like that because it's a Mac of course I can just stretch out get sidebar where I can see all my notes in
the sidebar which is really convenient just like this we also have a great view with a sidebar to show all your notes
you can use them to navigate your book when it comes time to study we have these great study cards you just flip
through them use all your notes
and that is iBooks in Mavericks so
Mavericks continues making your digital life follow you easily from device to
device so now your books are available on whatever device you choose to read them on remembers what page you're
reading we now remember your passwords so they're available to you across all your devices even now your bookmark
location and travel routes Mavericks is a fantastic release it's full of some
great features for power users deep technology to extend your battery life and improve system responsiveness and
some great features for everyone for those of you developers we have a
preview available for you today
and for everyone else from the general public you'll be getting the final release this fall so that is Mavericks
next I'm going to hand it over to Phil Schiller to tell you a little bit more about the Mack thank you
oh good morning everyone I'd like to talk to you about the MacBook Air the
MacBook Air answered the question in this age of the iPad what is the future
of the notebook the MacBook Air really gave us a direction of work the notebook
can go and its really become everyone's ultimate everyday notebook and that's
why we're really pleased to tell you today that we've updated an entirely new line of MacBook Air and these new
MacBook Airs deliver the most important feature we always want in a portable device all-day battery life
and the MacBook Air is based on a new fourth generation Intel Core processor
otherwise known as Haswell ult and if you don't know Haswell ult it's a great
processor for incredible power savings there's more energy-efficient CPUs there's twice the graphics execution
units so we can run them actually at a slower clock speed to save energy and still deliver the 40% faster graphics
performance and the Apple engineers have worked together with the Intel an inch engineers on some great low-power States
so we can do things like wake up in one second or have standby for up to 30 days but the biggest benefit is battery life
so here's the current generation MacBook Air 11 inch and 13-inch the 11 inch is
now going to go from 5 hours of battery life up to an incredible nine hours of
battery
and if you like that the 13 goes from 7 to 12 hours of battery-life yes true
all-day battery life and it helps across your entire system for example if you're
like watching movies from itunes up to 10 hours you can watch almost the entire trilogy of Lord of the Rings it's
amazing and of course MacBook Air is based entirely on flash flash is faster up to 45 percent faster than the previous
version and Wi-Fi is flat faster - now 802 11 AC Wi-Fi networking now AC gets
you up to three times the performance of a total 11n at the same distance but the
way to get that of course is you want your macbook air to talk to a Wi-Fi base station that supports a total of an AC
so we're really happy to along with macbook air announced some new airport base stations entirely new designs there
are actually a very small base just four inches square but extruded six and a half inches to get wider range from
those antennas so there's a new airport extreme that does 802 11 AC there's also room in there for a hard drive so if a
new airport time capsule as well and these are great base stations they're incredibly powerful they have a lot of
cool features i'll just point out one beamforming even sounds cool beamforming can send
more energy directly to an 802 love an AC device to enhance the throughput and performance so these are great base
stations the macbook air comes in 11 inch and 13 inch sizes and the value is
even greater than before the 11 inch starts at $9.99 with a hundred and twenty eight gigabytes that's twice the
storage at the same price as before and the 13 inch with 128 gigs starts at
1099 that's $100 less expensive than before and these new MacBook Airs start
shipping today
as we have for a while now we're really proud that we lead the industry and the most environmentally friendly products
so we're going to make sure everyone knows how important this is that Energy Star 5.2 most products don't ap gold
most stone arsenic-free display glass mercury fleet free displays BFR free PVC
free and highly recyclable we lead at this so we're going to continue to so
that's the new MacBook Air they're faster graphics longer battery life
better value faster Wi-Fi incredible notebooks I'm going to do something
different we don't usually do this but you're a really important audience so we'd like to give you a sneak peek of
something we're working on would you like that only because you're 6,000 of
my most important friends
video editors musicians photographers graphic designers count on products like
Mac Pro to get their work done and our most advanced users just want to get
their hands on the fastest most expandable Mac we make and the Mac Pro
is really important to delivering on that we didn't want to just make another version of the same old desktop idea
that everyone's had like with MacBook Air our engineering team has spent quite a bit of time thinking about the
technology available today and what could be possible for the future of a
pro desktop what would be a new form factor new design new capabilities for
another 10 years and the engineering team has come up with something truly
revolutionary truly radical and this product is so cool well I'm going to go
a little over the top and give it a grand introduction that is unlike any
introduction we've ever had for product so I am really pleased to give you our
closest friends the first glimpse of the next generation of Mac Pro
[Music]
can't innovate anymore my ass
this is
thank you this is a machine unlike anything we've ever made both inside and out the
processor graphics memory storage are all built around a new unified thermal
core that even sounds cool inside is state-of-the-art technology a new
generation Intel Xeon chip up to 12 core configs 256-bit wide floating-point pci
express gen3 this is double the cpu performance of the previous generation the fastest
memory we've ever put in a product ECC memory 1866 megahertz ddr3 on a four
channel controller 60 gigabyte per second bandwidth that's double the
performance of the previous generation internal storage is based on flash not
any old flash new pcie-based flash 1.25 gigabytes per second reads a gigabyte
per second writes that's two and a half times faster than any flash we've ever built
it's ten times faster than any hard drive we've put in a MacPro before all
expansion is external you can add storage arrays you can add expansion chassis x' over the brand new
announced Thunderbolt 2 this is 20 gigabit per second up to 6 Thunderbolt 2
devices per port it's backwards compatible with Thunderbolt 1 and firewire and it's double the performance
of the industry standard and industry-leading Thunderbolt 1 but the place where the team is probably gone
the most crazy and done something we've never done before is in graphics this is the first Mac ever that comes standard
with dual workstation GPUs AMD FirePro graphics in it you can configure it up
to 4096 stream processors 528 gigabytes
per second this is two and a half times the graphics performance the last generation and for those of you who use
OpenCL and you all know you should this took over seven teraflops of compute
power to applications of course you want to hook on the latest third-party displays and this supports 4k
displays yes multiple streams of 4k
displays you can have up to three 4k displays on the built-in dual
workstation graphics the Final Cut Pro
team is hard at work on a version of AutoCAD Pro 10 that will support all the performance and graphics capabilities of
this machine you can be this guy it is a
Mac unlike any we've ever made it delivers so much more performance capabilities and expansion than anything
we've made and here it is alongside the previous generation
the team is packed all this capability inside 1/8 the volume of the previous
generation now one thing everyone loved about the old generation Mac Pro is those handles on the top so you can move
it around to get access to the i/o well the entire top of the new generation Mac
Pro is a handle just put your hand in it you can spin it around get access to the
i/o it's all organized beautifully on the back for you there is audio 4 USB 3
6 firewire 2 being driven by 3 fo are 2 controllers and you guys who use this
stuff know what I'm talking about it's Gigabit Ethernet HDMI out and it
has a motion sensor so when you turn it it even lights up to show you where the i/o is it is a stunning product this is
without doubt the future of the pro desktop it is coming later this year it
said as a sneak peek it is designed by brilliant engineers in California and assembled here in the USA
guy is to see it put through its paces and what it can do we have a special
session tomorrow a lunchtime session for all the developers here where our good friends at Pixar along with developers
from the foundry are going to show you some amazing character animation from the upcoming movie monsters you running
on the new generation Mac Pro and you want to check it out and that's the Mac Pro back to you Tim
you're gonna love the Mac Pro it's it's killer next I'd like to talk about iCloud we've
now passed 300 million iCloud accounts making iCloud the fastest growing cloud
service ever now by comparison it took
Facebook five years to reach this many accounts one of the most popular
features of iCloud is iTunes in the cloud which makes all of your purchase content available on all of your devices
we now have 300 million users of this feature and they've read out in their
content 35 billion times now the backend
infrastructure of iCloud allows us to provide cloud services across many of
our products like Game Center our social gaming Network now with over 240 million
users 60 of the top 100 games on the App Store integrate game center support
right in their game iCloud is also has
incredible scale like sending 800 billion iMessages or a mind-boggling
seven point four trillion push notifications iCloud allows us to
seamlessly integrate cloud services into so many of our products across Apple in
both OS 10 and iOS today we want to
share with you how we are deeply integrating iCloud into the next version
of iWork and to do that I'd like to invite Roger Rosner up to the stage
Roger
hello all right let me tell you a little bit about I work I work is Pages Numbers
and Keynote and we think it's the best way to create beautiful documents spreadsheets and presentations of course
eirick was born on the mac and it has full support for the awesome feature set of Mac OS 10 and Mac hardware we also
have amazingly powerful and fully multi-touch versions of these apps on the iPad and on the iPhone
we think our multi-touch apps are the most powerful productivity apps ever created for a mobile device and later
this year we're gonna have awesome new releases of both our Mac and our iOS Suites but today I want to introduce the
newest member of the I work family introducing iWork for iCloud iWork for
iCloud lets you create beautiful documents right in a browser on a Mac or
on a PC and rather than talk about it let's just jump right into a demo
alright I'm gonna fire up Safari on my Mac here and go straight to my iCloud homepage
where you see three new app icons I'm gonna click on pages and here's all the
documents I've been working on on my Mac or my iPad and saved in iCloud I can create a new document by clicking plus
and I have a bunch of beautiful Apple design templates let's just open a document we were working on and as you
can see it's a beautiful Pages document great fonts graphics images page layouts
this is all happening on the web browser of course so I can just click here and type and over here I have all the
formatting controls in our new context-sensitive format panel so I'll just select some text go up to my Styles
choose a text style select some more text choose another I can click on some
images you see my controls now show me image controls you can click on a bunch
of styles choose that one now of course pages has always been great at handling
graphics so how do I add graphics well I drag one in from my desktop drop it in
there and drag it around [Applause]
alright now we know we live in a world full of Microsoft Office documents so how do we work with office well I have a
Word document here and I'm just gonna drag that in from my desktop and drop that in the pages for iCloud window it
uploads it I open it up and Here I am
editing a Microsoft Word document in pages for iCloud alright let's take a
look at numbers back to my iCloud homepage click the numbers icon again a bunch of beautiful documents as you can
see this spreadsheet has a bunch of different sheets in it great charts great tables and graphics here on the
last sheet we have a table that hasn't been finished so I'm just going to click in a cell hit equals we get help for the
over 250 functions that we have but I'll just type some select this column and
there you go my chart updates if I want to fill this across the rest of the table I just drag it across a real
spreadsheet again this is all happening in a web browser
all right let's try keynote I will open
this presentation here and it's a real
keynote presentation photographs text fonts I can rearrange the slides if I
want to I can add a new slide I'll click the plus button down here choose this
layout let's give it a title and let's let's
drag an image in move it around get the
alignment guides we all love from keynote double-click to go into masking mode scale up that mask a little
recenter it lets let's give it a photo border let's make the border a little
thicker let's let's rotate the image this is all happening in a browser it's
pretty incredible
how about animations let's add a cube animation here and click play and there
you see our beautiful keynote 3d animations in a browser window
[Applause]
all right I'm sure everyone wants to know how does this work on Windows well here it is this is a Windows 8 desktop I
have ie and Chrome here I'm just gonna fire up Chrome and it's logged in as the
same user I was logged into on the Mac so I'm gonna open that same document as
you can see it's the same there's the slide we just made let's go in there and
make that mask a little bit tighter and move it around a little and there you go I'm editing a keynote document on
Windows 8
all right that is our pride cloud now we know in a lot of cases that the best user experiences are made with native
app technologies but I think you can see with our for iCloud you can do some pretty great stuff on the web as I
mentioned we support ie rar we support Safari best I should say like all web sites we run best in Safari we also
support IE and Chrome and now you have I work on all your devices you can create
a document on your Mac you can edit on your PC and you can present from your iPhone we're gonna make this available
starting today as a developer beta just go to iCloud and we'll expand that beta
to include all users of iCloud later in the year thank you very much send us your feedback
okay next we'd like to turn our attention to Iowa's iOS is the world's
most advanced mobile operating system empowers the world's best mobile devices
iPad iPhone and iPod Touch we have now sold over 600 million iOS devices
it's an incredible number but it's
extraordinary and we're proud of it but it's not what drives us we want to make
the best products that people use more and love more than anyone elses and I'm
really happy to tell you people are using our products substantially more than anyone elses let me show you this
recent study from Experian showed that iPhone users use the iPhone 50% more
than Android users use their phone now this is incredible but but maybe not
surprising and if you look at mobile web share it's not
even close iOS is two and a half times Android and
if you look at iPads compared to all other tablets it's not even comparable
iPad is over four times more now this
shows up in a variety of ways as an example just like iOS customers buy more
of your incredible abs they evidently also buy a lot of everything else
according to a recent IBM survey both iPhone and iPad customers were
responsible for materially more mobile shopping traffic than all other Android
devices combined on the most critical day of shopping last year now it
probably doesn't surprise you if people are using them more they love them more
and this is what is most important to us
iPhone was named number one in customer satisfaction by JD Power not just once
but nine consecutive times the first time this has ever been done
and iOS satisfaction is literally off the charts change wage recently measured
it at 97% and if you look at those people that responded that they're very
satisfied and really look at the detail which I'm sometimes known to do you
would see that iOS blows out everyone else 20 points better than our closest
competitor and almost 25 points better than Android one of the reasons for this
is that we provide amazing software updates that provide users incredible
new features and we do this easily and make them available to as many users as
possible let me show you over 90% of iOS
users are using the latest version of iOS now that's in stark contrast to the
world of Android and by the way this is
the most ideal state of Android it only includes US version of Android which talked to the Google Play Store so it
doesn't include things like Kendall's and nugs but even then it's a pretty
bleak story more than a third of Android users are using an operating system that
was released in 2010 and if you look at
the customers of each operating system which are using the latest version it's
not even close now this isn't just bad for users but this version fragmentation
is terrible for developers as many of you know in fact if you do the math you
would find that iOS 6 is the world's most popular mobile operating system and
in second place is a version of Android which was released in 2010
now this is why we get so excited when we're working on a new version of iOS
because we know that we can positively affect millions of developers and
hundreds of millions of users and that is exactly what we've been up to the
team at Apple has been working incredibly hard on the latest version of
iOS and today it's a great thrilled that
I announced iOS 7
iOS 7 is the biggest change to iOS since the introduction of iPhone it's packed
with amazing new features and a stunning new user interface we prepared a video
to show you our thinking behind the design and I'd like to run it for you now
[Applause] [Music]
we have always thought of design as being so much more than just the way
something looks it's the whole thing the
way something actually works on so many different levels
ultimately of course design defines so much of our experience
[Music]
I think there is a profound and enduring beauty in simplicity in clarity in
efficiency true simplicity is derived from so much more than just the absence
of clutter and ornamentation it's about bringing order to complexity
iOS 7 is a clear representation of these goals it has a whole new structure that
is coherent and it is applied across the entire system
we've considered the tiniest details like refining the typography to much
larger ones by redesigning NB icons and developing a grid system allowed us to
achieve a much more harmonious relationship between individual elements
we've also incorporated a whole new palette of colors
distinct functional layers help establish hierarchy and order and the
use of translucency gives you a sense of your context these plains combined with
new approaches to animation and motion create a sense of depth and vitality
[Music]
[Applause] the iPhone responding to your movements
drives the parallax to create a whole new experience of depth in many ways
we've tried to create an interface that is unobtrusive and deferential one where
the design recedes and in doing so actually elevates your content even the
simple act of changing your wallpaper has a very noticeable effect on the way
your iPhone looks and feels across the entire system
while ios7 is completely new it was important to us to make it instantly
familiar [Music]
we wanted to take an experience that people know very well and actually add
to it to make it more useful to make you more enjoyable
to create it we brought together a broad range of expertise from design to
engineering with what we've been able to achieve together we see ios7 as defining
an important new direction and in many ways the beginning
[Music]
you are gonna absolutely love ios7 this
thank you this major effort this major effort is only possible because of the
incredible collaboration between Johnny and his amazing design team and Craig
and his incredible engineering team without further ado I'd like to invite
Craig back up to take you through iOS 7 the biggest change to iOS since the
iPhone
well on behalf of all of the engineers and designers who worked so hard to make
today a reality I'm absolutely thrilled to have this opportunity to show you iOS 7 let's take a look it's
unbelievable it's just gorgeous from the typography on this lock screen
to the vitality of the background of an animation to the home screen with these
icons looks so great they just look fantastic and you know a lot of us have our own
wallpaper you know we like pictures of our family there and now that liveliness actually carries through to the home
screen because as you move the device in your hand it actually tracks your motion and as parallax thix but you can see
behind the icons it's really incredible and it carries over across the system
this liveliness and we just take a look at something like weather where the motion conveys this information and
where the edge-to-edge design just takes advantage of every pixel on that Retina display it's so nice it's great for apps
you use every day like messages your
calendar your email is gorgeous your
friends never look more attractive and Game Center we just completely ran
out of green felt and wood as well this
has got to be good for the environment the clocks look great and even apps like
stocks and compass I mean they just have this look of precision the sense of purpose the best way to appreciate iOS 7
is to see it live I'd like to give you a demo right now so let's take our first
live look at iOS 7 here it is you can see how device actually responds to the
motion in my hand just slide out the lock screen you see how it slides in now I want you all to look away for a moment
while I type in my okay you can look again don't tell anyone about that so
here we are on the gorgeous new home screen let's go into weather see on
whether it's a little cloudy today I can actually tap here the degrees get more information like humidity and rain I
swiped through some locations clear and Sydney kind of hot in Phoenix here in a
Big Thunder Mountain it's looking a little little rough we've got some some thunder brewing oh yeah some heavy snow
here in the North Pole and tropical
storm here in Gilligan's Island I hope they got off that Island so
and it's more functional than ever if you pinch you get this gorgeous overview
of all your cities even with the time so it's a world clock as well let's take a
look at the calendar so clean its swipe
from days today like this turn it into landscape see your whole week at a
glance at a big week ahead zoom out scroll easily through your months even
go all the way out to the year let's take a look at messages you notice as we
scroll we have this great sort of playful motion the bubbles let's bring
up the keyboard you slide contents of the keyboard you see the layering and transparency gives you that sense of
context there's this gesture now from the left edge of the device it's great for using the device with one hand if I
want to just go back I can just swipe from the edge of the display pull back like that move in out so clean and
natural let's take a look at folders and it go here into my games folder can have
multiple pages store hundreds
take a look at Game Center
some of those good-looking friends let's take a look at male the type is just so
clean and you're drilling to a message look how you get these fullscreen edge-to-edge photos it's really great
and that gesture for moving in and out works here too of course it's just move between messages just like this it's so
great and if you just slide across in any item you can get it the trash and more options as well right here in mail
finally let's take a look at Notification Center same as always we can just swipe down from the top of
their Vice comes down with a nice thud you can see all notifications just my missed ones and we have this great new
today view so you can see your friends birthdays current look at the weather or
up coming in invitations your calendar your stocks and even a quick look at
tomorrow you know what's really great is for the first time ever Notification
Center is now available from the lock screen as well you don't even have to unlock your device so that's a quick
look at IO s7 it's a comprehensive end-to-end redesign of the user
experience installing iOS 7 on your phone is like getting an entirely new
phone but when you already know how to use one that's so much more beautiful and functional than ever before but I Oh
s7 is actually more than that it's also a major feature release as well I have
10 features I want to talk to you about today starting with control center
control center is something that's so simple and yet so essential you have
those switches that you just want to get to really quickly from wherever you are well now with control center swipe up
from the bottom of the device and there they are
turn on airplane mode adjust your brightness play a song even get a
flashlight and available from anywhere including your lock screen so if you
wake up in the middle of the night you need to find something your flashlights right there and that's control center
next let's talk about multitasking now iOS 7 has always been built on the
industrial strength foundations of OS 10 and sending trinsic powerful
multitasking capabilities but we had to be careful about how we've exposed these two applications because we want to
preserve great battery life now an iOS 4 we did add support for select kinds of
applications to do multitasking things like playing music in the background or receiving a voice over IP call while
your app was in the background well now in iOS 7 I'm pleased to announce that
we're going to have multitasking for all apps [Applause]
so how does it work well imagine you have an app that you're using constantly
throughout the day a social networking app or something and you're checking in all the time well iOS 7 is notices that
pattern of use and is going to provide that app with frequent background activity to stay up to date let's see
have another app you use maybe that you just check in on in the morning breakfast maybe at night after work well
iOS 7 notices that too and it's gonna give that app background cycles just in time so it's up to date for when you
need it now in addition to this intelligent scheduling iOS 7 does opportunistic
updates the average user wakes their device dozens of times a day and those provide great opportunities when the
system's already powered up to update apps in the background it also adapts intelligently to network conditions so
if it's an you have good coverage it's a great time to fetch and it coalesces
updates across multiple applications so once you have those radios power it up lets multiple applications take
advantage of it for their background updates and finally iOS 7 responds to push notifications as a trigger to give
that application time in the background so when you follow that notification the Apple are to be up to date
now I owe 7 also has a great new user interface for moving between all the
things you have going on on your phone now you can double click and move into
Notification Center and just swipe between your running applications tap and move right in and that is
multitasking in iOS 7
next let's talk about Safari Safari is the most popular mobile browser in the
world and in iOS 7 we're making it even better has a great new fullscreen look
really focus on your content if you pull down or tap at the top you can now get a
smart search field from that search field you can get it one tap access to all of your favorites
as well as do search and access URLs and it's a great new interface for your tabs
in addition to all of this it has parental controls and integration
with the same iCloud keychain you saw earlier with Mavericks I'd like to give you a demo of Safari now let's take a
look okay head on in to Safari so here
we are and Safari I'm gonna just zoom in on this page one you watch as I scroll all the controls just recede and now you
have that full screen for your content we've really improved the way you navigate now in Safari I'm just gonna
tap in here to a link to a detailed story we can even zoom in of course on
this page and that same gesture you saw earlier for going back well of course that works in Safari as well so I just
swipe in from the edge of the display and I can navigate back and forth through my browser history just like
that it's such a fantastic way to browse next let's look at that unified search
field I'm just gonna tap up here at the top you see how I have one tap access to all my favorites it's really convenient
but I'm gonna type in this case so I'll type D is and you notice I have a top
URL hit as well as Google search suggestions as well available all right here we've really improved bookmarking
as well I use this bookmark control down at the bottom I see my bookmark folders all my bookmarks we also have shared
links you can see stories posted by people you follow on Twitter and my reading list and now just like you saw
in Mavericks on iOS you can scroll tenuously from article to article without coming back to the list it's
really awesome next let's take a look at tabs I'm gonna
click here at the bottom into tabs unbelievable and you're no longer
limited to just eight
and down at the bottom are also all your iCloud taps you can see what you left open on your other devices as well and
tabs they're really nice to use you just tap sweep into a tab back out back in
back out it's just fantastic if you want to reorder your tabs just tap and hold just rearrange them like this and if
you're done with a tab just swipe it off to the side and it goes away and that's
the new Safari [Applause]
let's take a look now at control center so I'm just gonna swipe up from the
bottom of my display an up comes control center see have these great switches at the top you can turn on and off Do Not
Disturb for instance access my brightness can even access a flashlight really useful at night play a song and
of course this is available to me everywhere so if I'm in Safari for instance let's bring it up here you can
turn off that music and you notice how it's layering and transparency take the
personality the environment where you bring it up that's control center
next up multitasking it's just a great way to get across all the things you're doing on your device so if I just double
click here on my home button jump into multitasking I can just swipe across everything I have running you want to
move into one messages double tap back out move into mail back out just like
this it's really really nice that's multitasking in iOS 7 thank you
so of course there's there's much much more to iOS 7 including airdrop airdrop
is absolutely the easiest way to share with the people that are right around you so now when you're in any app that
supports a share sheet you bring up the share sheet and your friends that are all around you just show up right there
you tap on one and they're going to get a panel right on their display and they
can accept what it is that you shared they accept it they're taken right into the app and you know if you want to
share with multiple people you just tap tap tap no need to wander around the
room bumping your phone
now this is system-wide for any app that supports a share sheet and of course it uses peer-to-peer Wi-Fi for maximum
speed and all your transmissions are securely encrypted because it uses the latest Wi-Fi hardware it's supported on
the iPhone 5 the fourth-generation iPad iPad Mini and the fifth-generation iPod
touch and that is airdrop next let's talk about the camera so now your camera
in iOS 7 is four cameras in one you can just swipe from your video camera to
your photo camera to your square cropped camera to your pano camera and when
you're taking stills you now have access to live photo filters from some gorgeous
black and whites to some classic color papers as well so with your great new
camera I want to give you a great new way to manage your photos and it's the new Photos app you know for many users
this is what their photo organization looks like an endless unorganized stream
of their camera roll we've all been there but you know it doesn't have to be this way there's great information in
those photos iOS knows where you took the photos and when you took them and that provides inherent structure that we
can use to organize those photos and now in photos in iOS 7 we do we organize
them into moments I'd like to give you a demo of that right now [Applause]
so let's take a look now at the Photos app so here you see some photos that
were taken in San Francisco and you see nothing was done to organize these
photos explicitly and yet they have these labels like the Palace of Fine Arts Baker Beach Lombard Street it
provides this natural organization for appreciating the photos we can go up to more trips at more time in San Francisco
Golden Gate to San Francisco Fisherman's Wharf but then you see we have home we have photos taken at home and photos
taken at the elementary school and around that area and now if you want to zoom back out to get a more of a
bird's-eye view of your collection we draw these moments intelligently together into collections so see here
how that multiple day trip around San Francisco is collected sorry about that got a little excited there into it's a
very exciting interface into a multi-day trip in San Francisco and that time at
home and around the school well that's one moment that's one collection as well it's a really great way to browse your
photos you can even go all the way out to the year level look across your whole
photo collection
and look at how we pull out the interesting places that you went in that year like 2011 was Colorado and Hawaii
2012 went to South America you may not remember when you did it but iOS does it's right there and you know with this
Retina display you can even kind of make out patterns of photos and when different occasions are and of course we
found like we had the urge that we wanted to just tap in right from here and so now in fact you can you can just
tap and scrub and find the photo you're looking for just like that it's really
just amazing so I can just pick a photo here whichever one I want it's kind of cute and now we can edit it because we
have photo filters so I can go into the filters here I can try different color effects and if I find one I like maybe a
nice black and white can do it just like that I'll ply it save that photo away we also
have great new ways to share your photos in the photos apps let's bring up sharing we have a airdrop right here if
any of you were running iOS 7 ICU it looks like it didn't leak so that's good you're not in there right now but you
have airdrop you have access to other photos you can share them from right here just really handy great photo
sharing option is iCloud photo sharing I'm going to tap on that now it's going to iCloud photo sharing and from here I
can select the photo streams that I want to share - so I'm on Family Photos now but I'm going to drill in and I can see
other photo streams I've set up and now other people can share into my photo
stream as well so these are shared photo streams
I'll just select a photo stream here and type a little message we'll post that
photo so we've made it really easy to share and we've also made it a really great experience to experience the
photos you and others have shared with this new shared tab at the bottom so I'm gonna go in here see my photo with a
comment I can see the comments of other people and the photos that they've shared and now we even support sharing
video via iCloud photo sharing and we
have a great way to just browse those shared photos I just tilt the device in to landscape I can scroll through it
like this and just look at how beautiful that is what a great way to experience your
photos so that's the new Photos app in iOS 7
so integration with Internet services is a huge part of the experience of iOS and
never more so than an iOS 7 so to take you through some of those features I'd
like to bring up Eddy Cue Eddy thanks
it's great to be here so let's talk about Siri the first thing is Siri has a gorgeous new interface now as I speak
you'll see a sound wave across the bottom and you get the results in a
beautiful gorgeous clean way but Siri has always been a lot about you're the
voice of Siri and we've got an all-new voice for you and you can also choose a
male voice hi Eddy what can I do for you now we've got high quality thank you
we've also got high quality female and male voices for French
as well as German how's Connie 32 Nitti and we're gonna be adding other
languages over time now Siri is also getting a lot smarter it knows how to control more of your device so you could
say play my last voice mail or turn on Bluetooth or increase my brightness
and it can answer a lot more questions because we've integrated some new
services like Twitter so you can see what people are saying or what's happening we've integrated the world's
largest encyclopedia in Wikipedia and we've even integrated web search results
from Bing right inside of Siri and it's great for photos too and that's some of
the new features of Siri in iOS 7 now Siri is also a big part of our next
feature iOS in the car now 95% of the
cars being sold today have integrated music playback and control from an iOS device but we want to take this
integration to a whole nother level what if you could get iOS on the screen that
is built into your car so that you can make phone calls play music go to maps
get your AI messages right on the screen in your car or eyes free using Siri so
now when you make a phone call it's going to look something like this call John Appleseed or play get lucky or go
to maps get directions or even get your
AI messages read to you and you can dictate a response all eyes free
now all of these car manufacturers are introducing iOS integration in 2014 and
I know which one I want to buy and that's iOS in the car next the App Store
now the app store looks beautiful it's way easier to find apps than ever before
we've added a new feature where you can look for apps based on your age range kids categories parents are going to
love this and apps near me you can find the most popular apps based on your
current location so now let's say I'm at AT&T Park in San Francisco and here are
the apps I would see or I'm at the Louvre in Paris or I'm in Union Square
shopping it's that easy to discover new apps it's really great now the next
feature I know you're all going to love because every day you see something like this well no more because the App Store
updates your apps automatically
next let's talk about music the music app in iOS 7 is beyond a doubt the best
music player we have ever done the first thing you'll notice is we provide you with beautiful artist images right in
your library you just tap an artist and you see the songs but it's not just the songs on your device you see all of your
purchase music from iCloud right in your library and if you want to hear one of
the songs you just tap and you get our beautiful now playing screen but it's not just your purchase music in the
video apps you get all of your movies and TV shows right for my cloud right in
your library it's really really great [Applause]
you turn the device sideways you see your albums you can just swipe to see more and once you see when you like you
tap and zooms right in now the music app is the best way to listen to your music
but today we're introducing an amazing way to discover new music and we call it
iTunes radio
and here's what it looks like it's built right into the music app but rather than tell you about it I'd love to show it to
you and we'll launch the music app and
the first thing you'll notice is we've got a set of featured stations that our programming team have created so you can
see the songs that are trending on Twitter right now or even the songs that you guys are all going to hear this week
at WWDC but I feel like summer songs so
you just tap and once you have a station
you love you can just tap the I and you could share it with a friend or even create a new station based on this
artist or song I can easily skip to the sea what's the next song
[Music]
I'll go back to stations but it's not just the featured stations that we provide you can create your own stations
here are something that I've previously created what I feel like doing something
new now our music team is providing you with hundreds of stations based on
alternative country classic rock but I feel like doing something a little more
specific how about some Led Zeppelin
[Applause] so it starts off with a great Led
Zeppelin song let's go ahead and see what else is on this station and a great
thing is I can always modify the station I can just tap the star and I can say play more songs like this we're never
play this song or add it to my wish list now I like this so let's play some more songs like this now another great
feature of iTunes radio is it keeps track of all of the songs that you're listening to across all the stations all
your devices and you can get to them by just tapping history you can see them all here you can preview and buy right
from there and that's iTunes radio
so iTunes radio is built into iOS 7 it works on your iPhone your iPod Touch and
your iPad it's also built into iTunes on your Mac and PC and even in your living
room built into Apple TV iTunes radio is
free with ads and if you're an iTunes Match subscriber it's completely ad free
we're starting in the US and we'll be adding other countries over time and that's the new music app on iOS 7 it is
the best music player we have ever done thank you [Music]
Thank You Eddie so 10 amazing features
in iOS 7 and a comprehensive end-to-end UI redesign and of course we're bringing
it all to iPad as well now there's more to iOS 7 than we had time to talk to you
about in depth here today things like FaceTime audio where you now can do audio only high quality audio
calls over Wi-Fi on any iOS device
notification sync so if you dismiss a notification on one device you don't have to deal with it over and over again
on your other devices great feature for our users in China with integration of
the popular microblogging website site Tencent Weibo and for those of you who
have people who just won't let go phone FaceTime and message blocking also
for our enterprise customers per app VPN now there's yeah a couple enterprise
people in the audience alright so in addition to all this there's one feature I want to talk about in a little bit
more detail which is activation lock so hundreds of millions of us use Find My
iPhone to find our phone when it's just lost in the couch or maybe left at Starbucks but also when it's been stolen
and now with activation lock if a thief tries to turn off Find My iPhone or if
they even wipe the device entirely they will not be able to reactivate it
because they don't know your iCloud username
we think this is going to be a really powerful theft to turn now of course in addition to being a great release for
our users iOS 7 is also fantastic and major release for our developers as well
the SDK includes over 1,500 new api's can add airdrop integrate with
third-party game controllers new api's for taking advantage of multitasking ibeacons for Bluetooth le micro location
sprite kit for super fast power efficient game animations and you ident
to bring physics to your UI view animations so
so iOS 7 is available to you developers in beta on the iPhone today
we'll have betas for iPad coming up in the near from the coming weeks and for
everyone else a final release coming this fall so I've Iowa seven will be available for
iPhone 4 and later iPad 2 and later the iPad Mini and the fifth-generation iPod
touch that is iOS 7 I hope you love it
