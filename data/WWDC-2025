it continues our commitment to deliver the very best in entertainment made by the world's most creative
storytellers and we're incredibly proud that Apple TV Plus has once again been
ranked number one in quality programming for four straight years this is truly
amazing as you know WWDC is a special time of year and an important moment for
us to celebrate our global developer community we believe deeply in providing
developers with the newest tools and technologies to help them do their very best work and there's no better place to
do that than WWDC today we'll unveil some exciting new innovations and over the course of
the week we'll take a deeper dive with over 100 sessions as well as labs led by
Apple engineers providing valuable technical and design guidance by
presenting WWDC online and for free we're able to share all of this with
millions and millions of developers around the world the apps that developers create continue to make a
profound impact on all of our lives and these experiences are going to get
even better with some big announcements for all of our platforms so to get us started here's
Craig [Music]
iOS
we have so much to cover today i'm going to start with two things that are foundational to our platforms first is
Apple intelligence last year we took the first steps on a journey to bring you intelligence that's most helpful and
relevant for you like writing tools available virtually anywhere you type
genoji and Image Playground so you can express yourself in fun ways cleanup so
you can remove distractions from your photos and visual intelligence which builds on Apple intelligence so you can
easily explore your surroundings apple intelligence also made it easy for you
to find a photo or video just by describing it in natural language create a memory movie with a simple description
summarize emails notifications and notes to quickly get the gist craft your response with a single tap using smart
reply and more and we delivered all of this while taking an extraordinary step
forward for privacy in AI with private cloud compute which extends the privacy
of your iPhone into the cloud so no one else can access your data not even Apple
we also introduced enhancements that make Siri more natural and more helpful
and as we've shared we're continuing our work to deliver the features that make Siri even more personal this work needed
more time to reach our high quality bar and we look forward to sharing more about it in the coming year this year
we're expanding the languages supported by Apple Intelligence we're making the generative models that power Apple
Intelligence more capable and more efficient and we're continuing to tap
into Apple Intelligence in more places across our ecosystem throughout today's
presentation you'll see new Apple intelligence features that elevate your experiences across iPhone Apple Watch
Apple Vision Pro Mac and iPad plus this year we're doing something new and we
think it's going to be pretty big we're opening up access for any app to tap
directly into the ondevice large language model at the core of Apple intelligence with a new foundation
models framework this gives developers direct access to intelligence that's powerful fast built with privacy and
available even when you're offline we think this will ignite a whole new wave of intelligent experiences in the apps
you use every day for example if you're getting ready for an exam an app like
Cahoot can create a personalized quiz from your notes to make studying more engaging and because it uses ondevice
models this happens without cloud API costs or perhaps you're camping off-rid
pouring over the hikes you downloaded to all trails just describe what you're in the mood for and all trails can use our
ondevice models to suggest the best
option we couldn't be more excited about how developers can build on Apple intelligence to bring you new
experiences that are smart available when you're offline and that protect your privacy now there's another piece
of our platform story this year and it's a big one in fact it's the kind of
project that only comes along about once per decade it's a gorgeous new design
that feels effortless to use our last major redesign was iOS 7 back then we
were inspired by the recent emergence of retina displays and the amazing power of our A6 silicon well a lot has changed
apple silicon has become dramatically more powerful enabling software materials and experiences we once can
only dream of and our devices have become even more vital to our daily lives with more apps available than ever
our products are also more frequently being used together as you move across them throughout your day the stage is
set for something new that will enable great experiences for years to come
let's take a look [Music]
software is the heart and soul of our products it brings them to life shapes their personality and defines their
purpose at Apple we've always believed it's the deep integration of hardware and software that makes interacting with
technology intuitive beautiful and a joy to use ios 7 introduced a simplified design
built on distinct layers smooth animations and new colors it redefined our design language for years to come
now with the powerful advances in our hardware silicon and graphics technologies we have the opportunity to
lay the foundation for the next chapter of our software today we're excited to
announce our broadest design update ever our goal is a beautiful new design that
brings joy and delight to every user experience one that's more personal and
puts greater focus on your content all while still feeling instantly familiar
and for the first time we're introducing a universal design across our platforms
this unified design language creates a more harmonious experience as you move between products while maintaining the
qualities that make each unique inspired by the physicality and richness of Vision OS we challenged ourselves to
make something purely digital feel natural and alive from how it looks to
how it feels as it dynamically responds to touch to achieve this we began by
rethinking the fundamental elements that make up our software and it starts with
an entirely new expressive material we call liquid
glass with the optical qualities of glass and a fluidity that only Apple can
achieve it transforms depending on your content or even your context and brings more clarity to navigation and controls
it beautifully refracts light and dynamically reacts to your movement with specular highlights this material brings
a new level of vitality to every aspect of your experience from the smallest
elements you interact with to larger ones it responds in real time to your
content and your input creating a more lively experience that we think you'll find truly delightful elements once
considered for rectangular displays have been redesigned to fit perfectly concentric with the rounded corners of
the hardware this establishes greater harmony between our software and hardware or thoughtfully considered
groups of controls free up valuable space for your content liquid glass is
translucent and behaves just like glass in the real world its color is informed by your content and intelligently adapts
between light and dark environments and as a distinct functional layer that sits above your app the material dynamically
morphs when you need more options or as you move between views we've applied
this same dynamic nature across other experiences instead of taking over your whole display alerts appear from where
you tap context menus expand into an easily scannable list when you scroll
tap bars shrink to elevate what's in front of you and they instantly come back the moment you scroll up your
entire experience becomes more intuitive from navigating apps to system
experiences like the lock screen notifications and control center app
icons have been crafted with multiple layers of liquid glass and come to life in light mode dark mode colorful new
tints or an allnew clear look the new design extends to the dock and even to
your widgets giving you an entirely new way to personalize your experience we've always cared deeply
about every detail of our software design and it's these moments of beauty craft and joy that bring our products to
life our new design blurs the lines between hardware and software to create
an experience that's more delightful than ever while still familiar and easy to use
today marks an exciting and beautiful new chapter for our design one that sets the stage for our next era of our
products and how you interact with them every day we are so excited about this
beautiful new design and the way it brings greater consistency to our platforms which also gives us an
opportunity to bring greater consistency to the way we name them we're unifying
our version numbers across all our platforms our releases for the fall that
will power us through the coming year 2026 will be version 26 today we'll be taking you through all
these starting with iOS ios 26 is packed with intelligent experiences meaningful
improvements to the things you do every day and a new design where we've also refreshed a number of system experiences
and apps let's dive in starting from the moment you pick up your phone with the
lock screen and home screen the lock screen has been updated
with the time and controls now made of liquid glass and swiping up to your home
screen is even more delightful with this beautiful glass edge and a new sense of
responsiveness we've crafted app icons from liquid glass it makes them feel fresh while keeping them instantly
identifiable and it allows them to adapt whether you use dark mode or one of our
entirely new styles like our all clear look let's jump back to the lock screen
so you can see how we've made wallpapers more dynamic i'll switch to my photo
shuffle [Music] wallpaper and watch as I switch images
the time now fluidly adapts to the available space its San Francisco type
face has been uniquely crafted to dynamically scale the weight width and
height of each numeral in order to nestle into the scene and it doesn't just adapt to the
subjects of my photos it also keeps the best part of my photo in view as new information comes in like a message from
a friend or an email from a colleague and there's more we love using personal
photos as our lock screen wallpapers let me switch to another wallpaper to show
you with advanced computer vision techniques running on the neural engine we generate a spatial scene from your 2D
photos creating a delightful 3D effect bringing your favorite memories to life
as you move your iPhone in your hand now there's one last touch I really love
when I'm listening to music I can tap here and you'll see there's this gorgeous new way for artists to show off
their album artwork the animation interacts beautifully with the glass of
the playback controls really nice with gorgeous liquid glass that fluidly adapts our
captivating new spatial scenes and our re-imagine now playing experience the iconic lock and home screens are more
personal and expressive than ever next let's talk about another essential part
of the iPhone experience camera with so many great features it can sometimes be difficult
to find the ones you want especially when rushing to capture a shot with iOS
26 we're giving camera a new more intuitive design a simplified and
streamlined design elevates the two capture modes that you use most photo and video and all the powerful features
that you love in camera are just a tap away for example just swipe your finger
left or right to reveal additional modes like cinematic mode or portrait mode and
a simple swipe up lets you easily reach all your settings like aspect ratio and
timers and it's easier to change formats all the options become visible with a
single tap so you can quickly switch to 4K when you want to capture every detail
when you view your captures the Photos app takes advantage of the gorgeous new design many of you missed using tabs in
the Photos app photos now features separate tabs for library and for
collections where you'll find your favorites your albums and easy access to
search and the stunning 3D effect that you saw in the lock screen is available in photos so you can experience any of
your photos as an incredible spatial scene in Safari we've kept familiar
elements while creating a more immersive experience web pages now flow edgeto edge to the
very bottom of the screen enabling you to see more of the page the tab bar has
been redesigned to float above the web page and surfaces frequently used actions like search and refresh with a
tap liquid glass controls fluidly reveal other actions as you scroll the tab bar
dynamically shrinks to put your content front and center these dynamic controls
also look great in FaceTime when on a call your most important controls now
float on the bottom right and seamlessly recede when you don't need them we've also reimagined the FaceTime landing
page it's now a space that celebrates your closest relationships with beautiful personalized contact posters
video messages play as you scroll so you can preview special moments that you may have missed this updated experience also
extends to your car with CarPlay to tell you more here's Emily
[Music] carplay is the smarter safer way to use your iPhone while you drive it's used
over 600 million times per day and it's a must-have feature all over the world
we have some great updates this year to make CarPlay more beautiful and even easier to use with iOS 26 the new design
extends into the car for a consistent expressive experience while you drive it
brings updates across the whole system including icons that look great in light
or dark mode we've also added new features to help keep you connected
while driving like a compact design when you
get a call so you can still see what's on the screen like your upcoming directions along with tapbacks and
pinned conversations in messages ios 26 also gives you widgets
in CarPlay they're quick and glancable ways to get information which is perfect
while driving as well as live activities so you can stay on top of what's important to you like a friend's flight
status all done in a way to help you stay focused on the road for developers
the same widgets and live activities that you've developed for iPhone work in CarPlay
and for the ultimate CarPlay experience all of these updates also come to
CarPlay Ultra it's the very best of iPhone and your car with a unified and consistent
experience across all the drivers screens the first vehicles launched last
month bringing new ways to interact with features of your car carplay Ultra lets
you choose the layout and design of the most important information for you and
adds vehicle controls for features like the radio and climate right in the
CarPlay experience this is just the start of the CarPlay Ultra journey with
many more brands around the world working to bring this experience to market we're so excited to work with
different automakers combining their unique look and feel as well as vehicle
features with the power of iPhone and now back to you
Craig so that's a quick look at some of the ways the new design elevates your
experiences of course this is just the start ios 26 also has a number of
updates that will help you communicate stay connected and express yourself to
tell you more here's [Music]
Darren the phone app is fundamental to the iPhone experience so anything we can
do to make it easier to use can have a big impact this year we're giving you the option to choose a new unified
layout that brings together your favorites recents and voicemails so your mostused features are right at your
fingertips without having to switch views your favorites stay front and center so you can start a call with just
a tap your recents and voicemails now appear in a single convenient list below
so you can easily scroll to see who reached out and what they said and with Apple intelligence new voicemail
summaries help surface the most important information and at the bottom your contacts and the
keypad are still just a tap away this new intuitive layout makes it easier to
navigate the app while feeling instantly familiar we're also introducing a new way to help eliminate distractions like
unwanted calls which can get in the way of picking up the important calls we're waiting for now when you receive a call
from an unknown number call screening helps you quickly gauge whether it's something important or just another
pesky telemarketer building on live voicemail call
screening automatically answers calls from unknown numbers silently in the
background once the caller shares their name and the reason for their call your phone
rings and you can view their response and pick up or ignore
hi no hold on i'll be down at the gate in a sec we have another great experience to help you on your least
favorite kind of call one where you're put on hold we know how frustrating it is to be stuck on hold for what feels
like forever just to finally speak with a live agent well get that time back
with hold assist with hold assist the phone app can keep your spot in line while you wait for a live agent next
time you're stuck on hold whether it's because you're changing your flight or dealing with utility bills the phone app automatically detects hold music and
asks if you want it to wait for you when you tap hold the music stops but the call stays connected so you can keep
using your iPhone or even put it away and go about your daily routines don't worry once a live agent becomes
available we'll ring you to return to the call and let the agent know that you'll be there shortly so those are the
exciting updates to the phone app another way we stay connected on a daily basis is with
messages messages provides a shared space to express ourselves with the people that are closest to us this year
we're giving you an exciting new way to bring personality to those shared spaces with backgrounds when you select a
background it appears for everyone in the conversation to enjoy you have a variety of dynamic built-in backgrounds
to choose from or select one of your own photos and with Apple intelligence you
can even generate your own backgrounds in image playground next let's talk about group chats group chats are home
to so many age-old questions like "What weekend is everyone free?" Instead of dealing with a flurry of responses we're
introducing a delightful way to visualize what the people want with polls you can create a poll for anything
and with Apple intelligence messages can detect when a poll might come in handy and suggest one like if someone asks
"Where should we stay for our annual trip?" And when your more particular friends don't like the options anyone in
the group can contribute new ideas then watch as the votes roll in live and
groups are getting even better with Apple Cash now you can request send and
receive Apple Cash to settle up on concert tickets or the dinner bill right from the group chat we're also bringing
a highly requested feature typing indicators for your group chats which let you know who is about to chime in we
can't wait to bring you these exciting updates to group chats just like in the phone app we're bringing screening tools
to messages that help you eliminate distractions new ondevice spam detection gets spam out of your way and for even
more control we're introducing the ability for you to screen new senders so your messages go from this a list
cluttered with spam and unknown numbers to this giving you total control over
who appears in your conversation list unknown senders appear in a dedicated area where you can decide if you want to
mark the number as known ask for more information or delete until you accept
messages from unknown senders will remain silenced and won't appear as notifications even with unknown senders
turned on you'll continue to see important time-sensitive messages like your table is ready or a verification
code we're excited for another big year for messages and now to tell you how
Apple Intelligence is unlocking new ways to communicate here's Leslie
this year we're making everyday conversations more fun and more seamless
first there are more ways to create the perfect emoji now in addition to turning a text description into a Gen emoji you
can mix together two emoji to create something new like a sloth and a light bulb for that moment when you're the
last one in the group chat to get the joke you can even combine emoji with
descriptions so if you're inviting your friends over for a karaoke night you can mix a woman emoji with a microphone and
add a sequin jacket and when you're making images inspired by family and friends using Genmoji and image
playground you have even more control you have the option to change expressions like making your friend look
shocked or making them laugh you can also adjust things like hairstyle so the
image matches your friend's latest look and in image playground you can now make
images using chat GPT in addition to existing styles like animation or sketch
you have new ChachiBT styles like an oil painting style for your friend's contact poster so you can see her elegant
portrait every time she calls and for moments when you have a specific idea in mind tap any style and describe what you
want like a realistic image for a baby shower invitation image Playground sends your
description or photos to chatbt and gets you a unique image you're always in
control and nothing is shared with chatbt without your permission and for
developers you can integrate these new capabilities into your apps with the image playground
API now let's talk about a feature we're building across our communication apps
translation there are moments when you'd like to express an idea question or feeling but a language barrier gets in
the way to help you communicate across languages we're introducing live
translation with Apple intelligence live translation can translate conversations on the fly it's integrated into messages
FaceTime and phone and it's enabled by Apple models that run entirely on device
so your personal conversations stay personal for instance in messages live
translation can automatically translate text for you so if you're making plans
with some new friends while studying abroad your message can be translated as you type and delivered in their
preferred language and when they respond each text can be instantly translated
for you when you're catching up on FaceTime you can follow along with translated live captions while you
continue to hear your grandmother's voice
oh right yes when you're on a phone call your words are translated as you talk
and the translation is spoken out loud for the call recipients hi are you available to cater a wedding
on December 6th hello
as they respond you can hear a spoken translation of their voice ah
yeah ah yes I would be very happy to help you this works seamlessly even when
you call someone who doesn't have an iPhone for developers it's easy to enable live translation for calls within
your communication apps with a new API so that's live translation a powerful
communication tool whether you're traveling abroad collaborating at work or school or simply catching up with the
people who matter most to you and now back to Craig
beyond making it easier to stay connected we're also improving some of the Apple services you enjoy using on
iPhone to tell you all about them here's Kathy
[Music]
[Music] let's start with Apple Music we're
making it easier to fall in love with music from all around the world first we're adding lyrics translation to help
you understand the meaning behind your favorite songs and lyrics pronunciation so
everyone can sing along to the music regardless of language
and we're also introducing automix which uses intelligence to seamlessly mix from
one song to the next like a DJ time stretching and beat matching at the perfect moment
[Music]
and finally we're making it faster and easier to get to the music you're into right now with music pins just pin your
favorite artist album or playlist to the top of the library those are just some of the
updates coming to Apple Music next let's talk about maps in iOS
26 your iPhone can better understand your routines to improve your daily commute and help you remember great
places you've been most of us regularly go between places like home school and work and we often
have a favorite route with quick stops along the way like dropping the kids off or grabbing a cup of
coffee your iPhone will now learn your preferred routes and offer them in maps alongside other
options if your routine changes your iPhone will adapt to it and with the maps widget you can check your commute
before you leave so you can get an idea of how long it'll take if there's significant delays MAPS will send you a
notification with alternate route options even if you didn't start directions so when you have that
important meeting you won't be late due to an unexpected slowdown if you've ever wanted to return to a great local
business or park you went to in the past or recommend it to a friend but just can't remember the name we're
introducing visited places you can choose to have your iPhone detect when you're somewhere like a restaurant or
shop and then view your visited places in the maps library or simply search and
share with a tap your visited places are easy to delete with a swipe and are
protected with endto-end encryption so even Apple can't access them that's a
quick peek at maps next wallet apple Wallet helps make your day-to-day
interactions with the physical world that much easier car keys and wallet provide an
easy and secure way to lock unlock and start your car with your iPhone or Apple
Watch adoption by automakers continues to grow rapidly with over 20 brands
already offering car keys and wallet and 13 more coming soon including Acura Porsche and
Tata now let's talk about IDs with driver's licenses and wallet we've
created the most private and secure way for you to present your identity they're currently available in nine states plus
Puerto Rico with more to come and starting this fall you can create a digital ID with your US passport while
not a replacement for your physical passport digital ID can be used for domestic travel at supported TSA
checkpoints in apps and in person where age and identity verification are required and while at the airport you'll
appreciate refreshed boarding passes and wallet which now include convenient access to indoor mapping that gets you
around the airport quickly find My Track Yours right from the boarding pass and
sharable live flight status so loved ones can keep track of when you are landing next Apple Pay the easiest way
to pay with privacy and security built in used by hundreds of millions of customers it truly is a magical way to
shop and we're adding more convenient ways for you to pay in addition to using rewards and installments while shopping
online with Apple Pay you can now choose to redeem your points or pay with installments when you shop in person
wallet is also the best place to track your Apple Pay orders with Apple intelligence Wallet can now identify and
summarize order tracking details beyond your Apple Pay orders it will find emails sent by either merchants or
delivery carriers and conveniently pull together your order details order progress notifications and more all in
one place right in Wallet so those are some seamless new ways Wallet can
improve your interactions with the physical world ios 26 also brings new
experiences to your games and the friends you play with to tell you all about it here's an
[Music]
People love playing games on iPhone with stunning graphics powered by Apple
Silicon the App Store's huge catalog and award-winning games on Apple Arcade it's

easier to bring friends in on the fun with challenges a new way to compete
with friends in score-based showdowns you'll find them in some of the most
exciting games on the App Store like Thronefall where you can challenge your friends to see who can survive the most
waves of enemies and in popular Apple Arcade games like Skate City New York to
compete on racking up the highest score in each week's featured course and for
developers challenges are built on top of game center leaderboards so singleplayer games can be turned into
fun competitions with friends offering even more ways to rally a group see
scores in real time crown a winner and have a rematch so that's the Games app
your all-in-one destination for games and playing with friends and now back to
Craig we have one more update to iOS we want to tell you about today and that's a big
update to visual intelligence visual intelligence builds on Apple Intelligence to help you explore your
surroundings so you can simply press the camera control or action button to pull up ratings for a cafe you walk by or
find sneakers similar to the ones you see when you're out and about it's the fastest way to learn about the objects
and places around you and now we're extending visual intelligence to your
iPhone screen so you can search and take action across your apps using anything
you're viewing and we've designed it so you can tap into the capability of apps from across the app store to give you a
closer look here's [Music] Billy visual intelligence makes it
faster to do more with the content on your iPhone screen and it works automatically with any app say I open a
social media app and I see this great jacket i want to know where I can get something like this i can find out with
visual intelligence and I can access it with a familiar gesture by pressing the same buttons I use to take a
screenshot now at the top I have screenshot controls like markup and share at the bottom I have visual
intelligence tools like this image search button in the bottom right i could tap here to find similar images on
Google or other apps I use frequently thanks to visual intelligence I know where to get a jacket like this let's
keep scrolling i dig this lamp so I'll bring
up visual intelligence and now I can highlight a search for similar lamps across my most
used apps like Etsy and when I tap on a result I like it takes me right into the
app so I can save this lamp to my favorites now I want to see what else is
going on okay suppose I come across an event
I'm interested in and I want to add it to my calendar visual intelligence makes this
easier than ever notice the add to calendar suggestion at the bottom with Apple intelligence it can
extract the date time and location and prepopulate them i'll tap create event
easy as that i want to show you one last
example if I have a question about something on my screen like this instrument I can simply tap on the ask
button in the bottom left to ask chat GPT which rock songs is this instrument
featured in i love that I can jog my memory like this without jumping between
apps and there it is just what I wanted to know visual intelligence makes it
easy for me to search across apps take action and ask questions now back to
Craig so those are just a few examples of how visual intelligence makes it faster to do more with the content on
your iPhone screen for developers you can use App Intents to integrate search
capabilities from your apps into this experience we're also making it possible for you to search visually across your
mostused apps using visual intelligence with the iPhone camera so you can simply
point your iPhone when you want to search the Anthropology app for a cool item you spot at a cafe we're excited
for all the ways that visual intelligence will help you do more with what's in front of you so that's iOS 26
a stunning new design Apple intelligence capabilities integrated throughout the system and improvements to the apps you
use every day and it includes many more features that are going to make your iPhone experience even better next I'll
watchOS
hand it over to David to tell you about the latest on Watch OS
[Music] apple Watch is indispensable whether
using it to stay connected with friends track a workout or just live a healthy life and with Watch OS 26 we continue to
push this further with enhancements to many of the features you use every day and as you heard earlier it has the
gorgeous new design with liquid glass to deliver a fresh look while maintaining the instant familiarity of watch OS it
brings a more expressive experience in places like the Smart Stack the numerals of the photos face control center and
inapp navigation and controls while bringing more focus to your content in
addition to these design updates Watos now uses intelligence to gain a deeper understanding of you and proactively
give you what you need starting with workout for times when you need a little more inspiration Watch OS introduces an
exciting new fitness feature Workout Buddy with Apple Intelligence Workout Buddy can motivate you in a new and
unique way based on your fitness history here's Stephanie to tell you all about [Music]
it workout Buddy is pretty incredible it simultaneously gathers all the data from
your workout and rapidly analyzes vast amounts of your fitness history like
your paces miles logged activity rings closed even your training load to
identify meaningful insights in real time combined with Apple intelligence on
your iPhone it provides you with just the right encouragement a brand new textto-spech model
translates that encouragement into a dynamic generative voice it's built using voice data from a fitness plus
trainer so it has the right energy style and tone for a workout and you can
choose from multiple voices to hear the one that's right for you let's see it in
action the workout app is updated so it's easier to access what you need as
soon as you start your run workout buddy can kick off with a pep talk
great job starting your run this is your second run this week you're crushing it closing that move ring for six straight
days let's keep building on that with your run today fueled by some house vibes from
Muramasa workout buddy will also marquee moments four miles down your last mile was your
fastest yet coming in at 8 minutes and 56 seconds your average heart rate for
that split was 157 beats per minute and can help you celebrate accomplishments
you just crushed your 100th mile for running workouts this year keep up the great work
after you end your workout it recognizes your effort fantastic run you averaged a
pace of 9 minutes and 7 seconds per mile across 6.3 miles and your average heart
rate was 153 beats per minute plus you earned your first 10K run award and
that's something to really be proud of have a wonderful day and that's Workout
Buddy it's personal and private and will be available starting in English across the most popular workout types so no
matter where when or how you get your workout in it'll be the boost you need to reach the finish line workout is one
of the most popular apps on Apple Watch so we wanted to give it a brand new layout now features like custom workout
and race route are just a tap away so you can easily create a custom workout with work and recovery intervals or race
against your last or best time from your favorite route and there are new media features built right into the app for
your music you can keep it simple and let Apple Music choose the best playlist based on the workout you're doing and
the music you love or instead of having Apple Music choose you can select
playlists or podcasts that are suggested based on what you've been listening to for that type of workout so whether it's
your media or workout buddy getting active has never been more inspiring
back to David watch OS also enhances features like the
smart stack which has fundamentally changed how you interact with Apple Watch by quickly identifying what
matters in the moment and prioritizing that information for you this year the Smart Stack improves its prediction
algorithm by fusing ondevice data like points of interest location and more and
trends from your daily routine so it can accurately predict features that could be immediately useful to you so when you
walk into your gym for that regular morning session a Smart Stack hit will subtly appear and when you open the
Smart Stack a widget will be ready for you to start your workout or when Apple Watch detects that you're in a remote
location with no connectivity a hint will appear to start Backtrack to support you while you're off the grid
we're also making Apple Watch more proactive with enhancements to notifications you might use silent mode
to avoid receiving a loud alert at an inopportune moment like that but now Apple Watch can
interpret the ambient noise in your environment and automatically adjust the volume of incoming calls and
notifications much better and when you receive a notification that you want to address later a new wrist flick gesture
will dismiss it and take you back to your watch face you can also use wrist flick to mute incoming calls silence
timers and alarms or even close the smart stack wrist Flick adds to the
convenient gestures like double tap and we can't wait for you to try it for times when you do want to address a
notification like a text from a friend the messages app gets even better with many of the features you heard about
earlier with Apple intelligence live translation makes staying connected to your loved ones who speak a different
language as simple as raising your wrist conversation backgrounds elevate the
experience and now based on the context of the message you can quickly perform new actions that are intelligently
provided using machine learning like sharing your location through Find My when someone's looking for you we're
also giving you a quick new way to capture what's important with notes which now comes to Apple Watch it's
perfect for when you want to save a quick note to yourself or view an existing note like the great TV
recommendation you got from your friend so you can get started on season one of Stick right away watch OS also has new
APIs for developers the smart stack can intelligently show a widget for slopes
when you arrive at a ski resort with improved location APIs and now dark noise can add a custom control to
control center so you can easily turn on a sleep soundsscape without picking up your iPhone that's what's coming to
watch OS 26 a delightful new design with liquid glass more intelligence and
messages hints for the smart stack and a new wrist flick gesture and Apple Intelligence comes to fitness with
Workout Buddy next up here's Justin to talk about [Music]

[Music]
macOS
[Music]
mac OS is loved by everyone from students and creatives to developers and
anyone who appreciates its beautifully simple and powerful experience this year
we're building on what you love most about Mac OS with a release made for all
of its different users but what should we call it well our Crack product
marketing team was adamant that they'd fully earned their annual paycheck the moment they noticed that years end in
two-digit numbers but Mac OS demands more fortunately after carving some
bodacious tracks during one of their mandatory weekly ski strategy sessions
they bumbled into their legendary micro bus and let gravity guide them to a
breathtaking spot where crystalclear waters meet majestic mountain peaks
they'd found it let me introduce you to Mac OS Tahoe
mac OS Tahoe is all about giving you beautiful and powerful tools for the
unique ways you use Mac it includes many of the features you heard about in iOS
like backgrounds and screening tools and messages more options in image playground and Genoji and live
translation and it introduces many more updates taking the Mac OS experience to
the next level starting with a stunning new design it elevates the iconic
elements of Mac OS making them at once fresh and timelessly Mac from the moment
you unlock the desktop is instantly familiar widgets the dock and app icons
have been refined with liquid glass which also elevates the experience in
your apps sidebars and toolbars reflect the depth of your workspace and offer a
subtle hint of the content with an easy reach as you scroll this updated design doesn't just
look stunning it also enhances the Mac OS experience in new ways the menu bar
is now completely transparent making your display feel larger and there are more ways to customize what controls
appear in the menu bar and control center and how they're laid out there are so many new controls to choose from
you can even add controls for your favorite Mac apps like Zoom and iPhone apps too we've also unlocked entirely
new ways to personalize your Mac you can change the color of your folders and add a symbol or emoji to give them a unique
identity it's fantastic for projects along with your personalized
wallpaper and theme colors it's easier than ever to make your Mac a seamless extension of your style you can go for
that sleek clear look or dial up the dark aesthetic to match your workspace
no matter what you do this new design makes the Mac OS experience even more vibrant expressive and personal speaking
of great new experiences let's talk about the power of continuity continuity
helps you work seamlessly across Apple devices and we're excited to introduce two new continuity features first we're
bringing live activities to Mac so if you've ordered Uber Eats on your iPhone
the live activity also appears in the menu bar and when you click the app
opens in iPhone mirroring so you can take action directly on your Mac we're
also enhancing the calling experience by bringing the phone app to Mac you can
conveniently access your familiar content like recents contacts and voicemail synced from iPhone and easily
make a call with just a click incoming calls look beautiful on the bigger screen featuring stunning contact
posters of your friends and family and the phone app on Mac includes all the
great updates we talked about earlier like hold assist call screening and live
translation so that's what's new in continuity next
let's talk about some new features inspired by how pros work on Mac starting with shortcuts here's Raja to
tell you
more shortcuts help people get more done faster every day they combine multiple
steps from your favorite apps to create powerful personal automations in Mac OS Tahoe you can run them automatically for
example at a specific time of day or when you take actions like saving a file to a folder or connecting to a display
and with Apple Intelligence we're introducing intelligent actions that let you create shortcuts that are more
powerful than ever you'll see dedicated actions for features that you're already familiar with like summarizing text with
writing tools or creating images with image playground we've also added an
incredibly powerful new action that lets you tap directly into Apple intelligence models and provides responses that feed
into the rest of your shortcut for example if you're a student you can build a shortcut to compare your
recording from a lecture to the notes you took and add any key points you missed you can access Apple intelligence
models on device with private cloud compute or you can use chat GPT if you
want to tap into its broadw world knowledge and expertise one of the quickest ways you can run shortcuts is
with spotlight where we've got more updates to share spotlight has always been the central place to search for
things and now Spotlight is getting its biggest update ever to start Spotlight
is becoming the fastest way to browse your content on Mac it puts your most relevant files within easy reach
including intelligent suggestions based on your routines or what you're currently working on you can also see
all your apps and thanks to iPhone mirroring you can even launch apps that you only have on your iPhone like
Headspace we're also introducing system and app actions in Spotlight you can
take hundreds of actions from creating an event to starting an audio recording or even playing a podcast and you can do
this no matter what app you're currently working in you can even fill out parameters for an action say you want to
send an email you can write the message set the recipient and add a subject all
without lifting your hands off the keyboard plus many bar items for the app you're in can be accessed right from
Spotlight and for developers these are surfaced in Spotlight automatically this is great in a
featurerich app like Acorn to make taking action in Spotlight even faster
we're introducing quick keys these are short strings of characters that get you right to what you're looking for for
instance sending a message can be done by simply typing SM and adding a new reminder can be done
by typing a R and then just typing the reminder
quick keys are automatically provided for system and app actions you've taken now I want to show you how I use
Spotlight to get things done fast i'll type command space to bring up
Spotlight and search for a document where I've been working on a new feature idea searching in Spotlight is better
than ever all result types are listed together intelligently ranked by relevance to me and I can filter results
if needed too let's open this i have an image I copied to my
clipboard let me paste that in great next quick
resize looks good but maybe this would look better without the background
spotlight makes it so easy to take action from the keyboard i'll search for background removal and there's the pages menu item
i'll just hit return there we go let me quickly adjust where it
sits cool there's a chart that I copied earlier today that I want to bring in here too what's great is that with Mac
OS Tahoe I can now use Spotlight to get to my clipboard history here it is on the right this is
super helpful to get back to an image some text or a link I copied earlier in
the day there's the chart I had in mind i'll hit return and bring it into my dock and let's just resize
that and bring it into the corner perfect this is coming together
but it could use a better tagline i've got a shortcut I've built for moments like this i can run it from
Spotlight and I can get to it even faster with the quick key I've assigned to it ct for create taglines
spotlight is now contextually aware and suggests using the document I'm currently working in the shortcut then
takes that document taps into Apple intelligence models and gives me fresh ideas check it
out hm maybe okay that one's great i'll just
hit return to add that in love it now that this is in great shape I want to
add it to the free form board where my team and I organize our big ideas i'll search for that board in
Spotlight spotlight knows I add docs to this ideas board regularly so it
actually offers that as an action right here it's all ready to go with the document queued up and
everything awesome there it is with all the edits I just made i'll just move it
over here with my favorite concepts the team is going to have fun with this one
so that's a glimpse at how Spotlight and Shortcuts power up my workflow and for
developers you can make your app's content and actions discoverable in Spotlight and available for use in
Shortcuts using the App Intents API now back to
Craig from design to continuity and productivity Mac OS Tahoe delivers great
updates across the board it also levels up the gaming experience starting with
the new games app which brings together all the games you have on Mac and when you're in the game a click on a
controller brings up the new game overlay where you can adjust the system settings that matter most midame chat
with friends or invite them to play and for developers Mac OS Tahoe introduces
Metal 4 which brings next generation rendering technologies to games like
frame interpolation denoising and more alongside these improvements there's a
growing catalog of incredible titles so many games have recently arrived and
there are even more on the way like Crimson Desert from Pearl Abyss which
takes advantage of Apple Silicon to deliver incredible visuals and dynamic effects providing a breathtaking open
world with immersive details or Enzo which brings new life to playerdriven
storytelling with deep customization and gorgeous visuals apple silicon and metal
effects make every character and light source feel vivid and real while the neural engine delivers exceptional
performance for AI models you can pre-order Enzoy on Mac starting today
and it will be available later this year alongside consoles and PCs so that's
what's new with gaming on Mac and that wraps up Mac OS Tahoe a stunningly
powerful release it introduces a gorgeous new design delightful continuity experiences along with great
features to turbocharge your productivity next to tell you all about what's coming in Vision OS here's
visionOS
Mike just last year we delivered Apple Vision Pro a revolutionary spatial
computer that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world
consumers and enterprises alike love Vision Pro because it unlocks experiences that just weren't possible
before this year we're introducing an expansive update to Vision OS vision OS

these and more can be found in the new widgets app including ones from your favorite compatible apps and developers
can create widgets for their apps too vision OS will also remember where
you put your apps so you can arrange your space with digital content that will be there every time you put on
Vision Pro even if you restart it earlier iOS introduced us to spatial
scenes and they're also coming to Vision OS here's Haley to tell you about
it last year we made it easy to add natural looking depth to your 2D photos
with Vision OS 26 we're making your memories feel even more realistic it
uses a new AI algorithm that leverages computational depth to create multiple perspectives from your 2D photos making
the images more lifelike these spatial scenes feel as if you could lean right into them and look
around we can't wait for you to try this out in the photos app you can also view these in the new spatial gallery app
where you can explore fresh and exciting content curated by Apple spatial scenes
will make your web browsing experience more engaging too simply select spatial browsing to transform supported articles
hiding distractions and revealing inline photos that come alive as you scroll and
developers like Zillow can add them into their own apps for more lifelike experiences too some of the best experiences on
Vision Pro are shared with others so to make sharing even better we're making big changes to Personas we first
released Personas as a beta feature that represents you when you're on a video call with Vision OS 26 Personas will
undergo a dramatic transformation and more realistically represent you these
enhancements are striking hair lashes complexion all look remarkably accurate
making your persona feel more natural and familiar and they're still created on device in a matter of seconds today
personas let you connect with others who are located remotely but what if you want to share that same Vision Pro
experience with someone who's in the room with you now you and your friends can watch the
latest movie or play a spatial game together and this will be great for
enterprise where users can collaborate using apps like 3D Live from Deso System
to visualize 3D designs in person and with remote colleagues
to tell you about even more enterprise features back to Mike
hundreds of companies worldwide use Vision Pro's unique hardware and software to supercharge their workflows
for design training sales and more with Vision OS 26 organizations can easily
share a common pool of devices among team members and you can securely save your eye and hand data vision
prescription and accessibility settings to your iPhone so you can quickly start to use a shared team device or a
friend's vision pro as a guest user we're also adding more APIs so enterprises can create revolutionary
apps only possible on vision OS for instance the new protected content API
it's literally a for your eyeson only mode ensuring that only people who've been granted access can see confidential
materials like medical records or business forecasts we're also expanding how you
can interact with content and experiences by introducing support for spatial accessories that enable input in
six degrees of freedom we're excited to share Logitech Muse built for Vision Pro
which unlocks entirely new creative workflows logitech Muse will let you draw and collaborate in three dimensions
with precision in apps like spatial analog and we're thrilled to share that
Sony is bringing support for PlayStation VR2 sense controller to Vision OS
26 games for Vision OS like Pickle Pro can take advantage of the full motion
tracking performance for more engaging gameplay of course people aren't just
working and playing in Vision Pro they also love watching spatial content like
Apple Immersive Video which puts you at the heart of the most exciting stories
events and adventures with unmatched realism and with Vision OS 26 we're
enabling more ways to produce great new content like the brand new Adobe app for
Vision OS powered by Premiere that will let you edit and preview spatial video
directly in Vision Pro many people have extensive libraries of
exciting action videos but playing them on traditional 2D displays makes them appear flat and distorted to solve this
we've partnered with GoPro Insta3 and Canon to support native playback of 180
360 and wide fieldof view video on Vision OS you can now relive these
awesome moments like you're there all over again and web developers can embed
3D objects directly into their pages so you can see them in line with depth and
dimension and pull them right into your space for a closer look this combined
with spatial browsing marks the beginning of the spatial web and there
are many other new features we think you'll love like a spectacular new Jupiter environment
standing on the moon Amla you'll be able to speed up time to watch enormous
storms swirl across the gas giant as sunlight breaks across its surface and that's Vision OS 26 a huge
release that delivers more spatial experiences than ever before new ways to
stay connected with Vision Pro users near and far and big opportunities for
enterprises developers and creators to deliver groundbreaking features and
content now here's Craig to tell you about what's coming in iPad
iPadOS
OS ipad OS 26 is a giant release it starts with a beautiful new design
making your entire experience more delightful from the lock screen with a new time layout to the home screen with
redesigned app icons and widgets to apps like Apple TV where there's even more
focus on your content and with Apple Intelligence integrated across iPad OS
you can communicate seamlessly across language barriers with live translation and tap into Apple intelligence to
supercharge your shortcuts there are also many other features you heard about on iOS and Mac OS that are
great for everyone who uses iPad including messages with polls and enhanced group chats the new phone app
which lets you make and take calls and the brand new games app for all your games and the friends you play with and
all these amazing features are only the start over the years we've pushed the
limits of how portable powerful and versatile iPad can be and it's empowered
customers around the world whether they're just trying to escape with some me time on the couch or using iPad as a
canvas to imagine their next big endeavor so many people feel deeply connected to iPad and some want to do
even more with it so this year we're continuing to push the capabilities of iPad OS even further by focusing on
improving multitasking and how you work with files and audio and video let's get
started with multitasking where we're taking a huge leap forward this is what
you've all been waiting for a new windowing system on iPad
it's designed for the unique qualities of iPad and delivers on what users are asking for with a collection of powerful
features that help you control arrange and switch between your windows and we
think it's pretty great to show it to you here's Cindy
this rearchitected and redesigned windowing system maintains the simplicity of iPad when I first open an
app it shows up full screen i can swipe home and open another and it's still
full screen so if this is how you like to use iPad it's just as simple as ever
but now I also have this grab handle in the bottom right to fluidly resize apps into Windows if I previously resized
apps when I open them again they open back in the exact same size and position
and I can place them just where I want them this is designed to work great with touch or with a trackpad
and now I also have a pointer that's more precise and responsive when I use
it to hover over these new buttons in the top left they expand into familiar controls i can use these to close or
minimize my windows and a tap on their app icon brings them right back another
way I can arrange my windows is with tiling since this is designed for the unique qualities of iPad I can simply
flick windows towards the edges to tile it's so fluid and makes arranging my
windows super easy there's even a little grabber here to resize both at the same
time if I click and hold on my window controls I'll see even more tiling options let's choose
quarters with this rearchitected windowing system I also have the power to open even more
windows and if I need an app that's not in my doc I can simply swipe home to peek at my home screen tapping an app
opens it along with all my previous windows to quickly see all my open windows I now have expose with a swipe
up from the bottom and hold my windows spread out and a tap brings the one I need to the front if I need to make
space or focus in on one app I just swipe home and another swipe up minimizes everything so now when I open
an app it opens by itself and I can start fresh making it easy to always get
back to the distinct simplicity of iPad sometimes you need a way to see and
access all the features of an app so we're also adding a menu bar on iPad
it's always available from the top of the screen it's arranged to be familiar with clear labeled
options and it's a great way to find the features you need quickly and that's a quick look at the menu bar
and how windowing works in iPad OS 26 back to you Craig
wow more windows a pointier pointer and a menu bar who would have thought we've
truly pulled off a mindblowing release and this isn't just great on iPad Pro
and iPad Air the new windowing architecture has enabled us to bring it to every iPad that runs iPad OS 26
including iPad and iPad Mini it also works great with Stage Manager and on
external displays it's a massive update to the way you work with multiple apps
at once on iPad now to tell you about some other updates here's Tona
let's talk about files when you're working on more complex projects like creating a website editing a lot of
photos or designing a presentation you're often handling lots of files across lots of apps to make this easier
we have a set of enhancements for managing accessing and editing your
files first up we're supercharging the Files app it now includes features like
an updated list view to see more details and resizable columns and collapsible
folders it also gets the same folder customization options as Mac OS with
custom colors and icons that sync across devices making it easy to spot the one you're looking for and you can now
choose which app you want to open a file with and set it as a default like picking Photoshop Visco or Dark Room for
opening images for easier access to your files you can now put folders in the
dock simply drag any folder from the files app right into the dock when you
tap on one it fans out showing the files inside perfect for getting to your
downloads most recent documents or a favorite folder no matter what app you're in and it's easy to drag in and
out of your folders too now one type of file you might be opening is a PDF and
to help you with that we're bringing a beloved app from Mac OS to iPad OS Preview preview is a dedicated app to
view and edit your PDFs with powerful tools like Apple Pencil Markup and
Autofill making it easy to access annotate fill in or highlight and it
also includes familiar tools to edit images and export them in a variety of different formats and
sizes with the updated files app folders in the doc and preview it's never been
easier to work with files in iPad OS this year we're also enabling more
complex workflows for working with audio and video beginning with better control
over your audio input content creators want to have control over their setup
including the accessories that give them the best quality like high-end microphones to help easily specify which
microphone to use we added an audio input selector it can even be used to choose a different one for each app this
applies to the web as well so creators can use their favorite sites like Alatu to capture audio with the microphone
best suited for the job audio can be made even better by blocking ambient
sounds while recording so we're making voice isolation available no matter what app is being used keeping voices clear
and crisp for even more convenience creators can now record studio quality
vocals directly with AirPods thanks to improved tonal balance and tambber to
authentically represent the texture of your voice making AirPods a great choice for producing content and to make
recording from a distance even easier creators can use AirPods to start and stop video recording with a simple press
and hold we've also made something for all you podcasters out there who record using video
calls local capture lets you produce amazing content with high-quality recordings right from iPad it works with
any of your favorite video conferencing apps just turn it on in control center and your own local highquality audio and
video are captured on your iPad echo cancellation of other participants audio
keeps your voice front and center so you get a clear recording of your side of the call so glad once it's over everyone
who use local capture can easily share their own audio and video files letting you produce an interview or podcast with
the clearest recordings gathered from every source next when it's time to edit and
export your content we're making that even easier by enabling background tasks on iPad with the incredible power of
Apple silicon iPad can run longunning and computationally heavy tasks in the
background so if you start an extended process like an export and switch to
another app the task will continue to run background tasks show up as live activities so you always know what's
running and you always have full control and for developers apps like Shaper 3D
and Da Vinci Resolve will be able to take advantage of the same continuous processing with an updated background
tasks API combined with updates for controlling your audio input and
capturing highquality content these improvements will make Creative Pros even more effective back to you
Craig with accelerated workflows for working with audio and video huge
improvements to working with files and the biggest update to windowing on iPad ever this release of iPad OS is a
gamecher we couldn't be more excited for you to try it and there's even more that
we didn't have time to cover today like advanced 3D graphing capabilities in math notes a new read pen for a
traditional calligraphy experience and the journal app which comes to iPad with Apple Pencil support so that's iPad OS
26 with a new design even more features powered by Apple intelligence and a
giant leap forward in productivity it takes iPad's unique capabilities even
further this is the biggest iPad OS release ever
so those are the updates to our software platforms with so many helpful features
to enhance your daily activities and as you saw throughout today's presentation
with Apple Intelligence our platforms are more powerful and more useful than ever we're continuing to integrate Apple
intelligence across our ecosystem with so many new features that are right where you need them in the apps you use
every day whether you're communicating across languages with live translation exploring the content of any app with
visual intelligence feeling motivated during a run with Workout Buddy accelerating your workflows with
powerful shortcuts and more these brand new Apple intelligence features continue
to elevate your iPhone Apple Watch Apple Vision Pro Mac and iPad with
intelligence that is most helpful and relevant for you and as you've seen in
Developers
addition to everything in these releases for our users it's also a huge year for
developers the foundation models framework allows developers to use our models and get
responses in plain text or as structured swift data app intents allow developers to
connect their apps content and capabilities throughout the system including the new shortcuts and visual
intelligence experiences and there's much more to discover in our SDKs like
the latest improvements to Swift which make it easier than ever to write code that's safe and efficient or the new
APIs in Swift UI helping developers build modern user interfaces across all
Apple platforms of course this year one of the most important updates for
developers is the new design with liquid glass it lets developers reimagine how
their apps look and feel making every user interaction even more intuitive and
delightful to dive deeper we have dedicated sessions and opportunities to engage with Apple engineers and
designers over the course of this week we also have exciting updates for our tools like the new Icon Composer app
icon Composer helps developers and designers create layered icons that look
stunning in light dark tinted and all clear look visualizing how light
interacts with liquid glass and we're bringing more generative intelligence to Xcode predictive code
completion gets more accurate using larger context from your code and we've expanded our vision for Swift Assist
where developers interact with code using natural language directly in Xcode developers can now use a model of their
choice and we have built-in support for the advanced coding models of Chat GPT
this unique experience flows naturally between the source editor and the assistant to write code tests
documentation iterate on a design or fix that stubborn compiler error you'll hear
all about these new tools and technologies in the platform state of the union and now back to
[Music]
