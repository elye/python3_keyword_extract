>>Sundar Pichai: WELCOME. WELCOME TO GOOGLE I/O. AND WELCOME TO SHORELINE. IT FEELS REALLY NICE AND
DIFFERENT UP HERE. WE'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR MANY, MANY YEARS IN MOSCONE, AND IN FACT, WE'VE BEEN DOING I/O
FOR 10 YEARS BUT I FEEL WE ARE AT A PIVOTAL MOMENT IN TERMS OF WHERE WE ARE GOING AS A COMPANY AND FELT IT
APPROPRIATE TO CHANGE THE VENUE. DOING IT HERE ALSO ALLOWS US TO INCLUDE A LOT MORE OF YOU.
THERE ARE OVER 7,000 OF YOU JOINING IN PERSON TODAY. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND LATER TODAY, AFTER THE
KEYNOTE, YOU'LL BE JOINED BY SEVERAL GOOGLERS, PRODUCT MANAGERS, ENGINEERS, AND DESIGNERS, SO HOPEFULLY
YOU'LL ENGAGE IN MANY, MANY CONVERSATIONS OVER THE THREE DAYS. AS ALWAYS, I/O IS BEING LIVE
STREAMED AROUND THE WORLD. THIS YEAR WE HAVE THE LARGEST-EVER AUDIENCE. WE ARE LIVE STREAMING THIS TO
530 EXTERNAL EVENTS IN OVER A HUNDRED COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING DUBLIN, WHICH IS A MAJOR TECH HUB IN
EUROPE. [ CHEERS ] ISTANBUL, WHICH IS OUR OLDEST GOOGLE DEVELOPER GROUP.
[ CHEERS ] AND EVEN TO COLOMBO SRI LANKA, WHICH IS THE LARGEST OUTSIDE OF THE
UNITED STATES WITH 2,000 PEOPLE. [ CHEERS ] OUR LARGEST DEVELOPER
AUDIENCE ON THE LIVE STREAM IS FROM CHINA TODAY WITH OVER 1 MILLION PEOPLE TUNING IN LIVE FROM CHINA, SO WELCOME
TO THOSE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE LIVE IN VERY, VERY EXCITING TIMES. COMPUTING
HAS HAD AN AMAZING EVOLUTION. STEPPING BACK, LARRY AND
SERGEY FOUNDED GOOGLE 17 YEARS AGO WITH THE GOAL OF HELPING USERS FIND THE INFORMATION THEY NEED. AT
THE TIME, THERE WERE ONLY 300 MILLION PEOPLE ON LINE. MOST OF THEM WERE ON BIG PHYSICAL COMPUTERS, ON SLOW
INTERNET CONNECTIONS. FAST-FORWARD TODAY. THANKS TO THE RATE AT WHICH PROCESSORS AND SENSORS HAVE
EVOLVED, IT IS TRULY THE MOMENT OF MOBILE. THERE ARE OVER 3 BILLION PEOPLE CONNECTED AND THEY ARE USING
THE INTERNET IN WAYS WE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. THEY LIVE ON THEIR PHONES. THEY USE IT TO COMMUNICATE, LEARN NEW
THINGS, GAIN KNOWLEDGE, ENTERTAIN THEMSELVES. THEY TAP AN ICON, EXPECT A CAR TO SHOW UP. THEY TALK TO THEIR
PHONES AND EVEN EXPECT MUSIC TO PLAY IN THE LIVING ROOM. OR SOMETIMES GROCERIES TO SHOW UP AT THE FRONT DOOR.
SO WE ARE PUSHING OURSELVES REALLY HARD SO THAT GOOGLE IS EVOLVING AND STAYING A STEP AHEAD OF OUR USERS.
ALL THE QUERIES YOU SEE BEHIND ME ARE LIVE QUERIES COMING IN FROM MOBILE. IN FACT, TODAY, OVER 50% OF OUR
QUERIES COME FROM MOBILE PHONES. AND THE QUERIES IN COLOR YOU SEE BEHIND ME ARE VOICE QUERIES. IN THE U.S.,
ON OUR MOBILE APP IN ANDROID, ONE IN FIVE QUERIES -- 20% OF
OUR QUERIES -- ARE VOICE QUERIES AND THAT SHARE IS GROWING. GIVEN HOW DIFFERENTLY USERS ARE
ENGAGING WITH US, WE WANT TO PUSH OURSELVES AND DELIVER THEM INFORMATION, RICH INFORMATION, IN THE CONTEXT
OF MOBILE. THIS IS WHY, IF YOU COME TO GOOGLE TODAY AND SEARCH FOR BEYONCE, YOU DON'T JUST GET
TEN BLUE LINKS. YOU GET A RICH INFORMATION CARD WITH MUSIC. YOU CAN LISTEN TO HER SONGS, FIND INFORMATION ABOUT
UPCOMING SHOW EVENTS, AND BOOK IT RIGHT THERE. YOU CAN COME AND ASK US DIFFERENT QUERIES. PRESIDENTIAL
ELECTIONS OR CHAMPIONS LEAGUE, AND WE AGAIN GIVE YOU RICH IN-DEPTH INFORMATION. AND WE DO THIS ACROSS
THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF CATEGORIES GLOBALLY AT SCALE.
YOU CAN COME TO GOOGLE LOOKING FOR NEWS AS WELL. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN HYPERLOOP, AN
EXCITING TECHNOLOGY, WE GIVE YOU INFORMATION WITH AMP RIGHT THERE IN SEARCH RESULTS AND THEY LOAD INSTANTLY AND
YOU CAN SCROLL THROUGH THEM. AMAZING TO SEE HOW PEOPLE ENGAGE DIFFERENTLY WITH GOOGLE. IT'S NOT JUST ENOUGH
TO GIVE THEM LINKS. WE REALLY NEED TO HELP THEM GET THINGS DONE IN THE REAL WORLD.
THIS IS WHY WE ARE EVOLVING SEARCH TO BE MUCH MORE ASSISTIVE. WE'VE BEEN LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR THIS FOR
MANY, MANY YEARS THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN DEEP AREAS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE. WE BUILT THE KNOWLEDGE GRAPH. WE
TODAY HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF 1 BILLION ENTITIES. PEOPLE, PLACES, AND THINGS. AND THE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN
THEM AND THE REAL WORLD. WE HAVE DRAMATICALLY IMPROVED THE QUALITY OF OUR VOICE RECOGNITION. WE RECENTLY
STARTED TRAINING OUR DATA SETS WITH NOISY BACKGROUNDS DELIBERATELY, SO THAT WE CAN HEAR PEOPLE MORE ACCURATELY.
THE QUALITY HAS IMPROVED RECENTLY BY 25%. IMAGE RECOGNITION AND COMPUTER VISION. WE CAN DO
THINGS WHICH WE NEVER THOUGHT WE COULD DO BEFORE. IF YOU'RE IN GOOGLE PHOTOS TODAY, AND YOU SEARCH FOR
HUGS, WE ACTUALLY PULL AN ALL THE PICTURES OF PEOPLE HUGGING IN YOUR PERSONAL COLLECTION.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE RECENTLY EXTENDED THIS TO VIDEOS, SO YOU CAN SAY "SHOW ME MY DOG VIDEOS"
AND WE ACTUALLY GO THROUGH YOUR VIDEOS AND PULL OUT YOUR FAVORITE VIDEOS. TRANSLATION.
10 YEARS AGO, WE COULD TRANSLATE, MACHINE-TRANSLATE IN TWO LANGUAGES. TODAY WE DO THAT FOR OVER A HUNDRED
LANGUAGES AND EVERY SINGLE DAY WE TRANSLATE OVER 140 BILLION WORDS FOR OUR USERS.
WE EVEN DO REALTIME VISUAL TRANSLATION. IF YOU'RE A CHINESE USER AND YOU RUN INTO A MENU IN ENGLISH, ALL YOU
NEED TO DO IS TO HOLD UP YOUR PHONE AND WE CAN TRANSLATE IT INTO ENGLISH FOR YOU. PROGRESS IN ALL OF THESE
AREAS IS ACCELERATING, THANKS TO PROFOUND ADVANCES IN MACHINE LEARNING AND AI, AND I BELIEVE WE ARE AT A SEMINAL
MOMENT. WE AS GOOGLE HAVE EVOLVED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS AND WE BELIEVE WE
ARE POISED TO TAKE A BIG LEAP FORWARD IN THE NEXT 10 YEARS. SO LEVERAGING OUR STATE-OF-THE-ART CAPABILITIES
IN MACHINE LEARNING AND AI, WE TRULY WANT TO TAKE THE NEXT STEP IN BEING MORE ASSISTIVE FOR OUR USERS. SO
TODAY, WE ARE ANNOUNCING THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] SO WHAT DO WE MEAN WHEN WE
SAY "THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT"? WE WANT TO BE THERE FOR OUR USERS ASKING THEM, "HI, HOW CAN I HELP?" WE THINK OF THE
ASSISTANT IN A VERY SPECIFIC WAY. WE THINK OF IT AS A CONVERSATIONAL ASSISTANT. WE WANT USERS TO HAVE AN
ONGOING, TWO-WAY DIALOGUE WITH GOOGLE. WE WANT YOU TO HELP GET THINGS DONE IN YOUR REAL WORLD AND WE WANT TO DO
IT FOR YOU, UNDERSTANDING YOUR CONTEXT, GIVING YOU CONTROL OF IT. WE THINK OF THIS AS BUILDING EACH USER
THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL GOOGLE. WE ALREADY HAVE ELEMENTS OF THE ASSISTANT WORKING HARD FOR OUR USERS. I MENTIONED
EARLIER THAT 20% OF QUERIES ON OUR MOBILE APP IN ANDROID IN THE U.S. ARE VOICE QUERIES. EVERY SINGLE DAY,
PEOPLE SAY OKAY, GOOGLE. AND ASK US QUESTIONS THAT WE HELP THEM WITH AND WE HAVE STARTED BECOMING TRULY CONVERSATIONAL
BECAUSE OF OUR STRENGTHS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN BE IN FRONT OF THIS STRUCTURE IN
CHICAGO AND ASK GOOGLE, "WHO DESIGNED THIS?" YOU DON'T NEED TO SEE "THE BEAN" OR "THE CLOUD GATE." WE
UNDERSTAND YOUR CONTEXT AND WE ANSWER THAT THE DESIGNER IS ANEARBY ANISH KAPOOR. HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE. YOU
CAN ASK GOOGLE, "WHO DIRECTED THE REVENANT?" >>Google: THE RELEVANT WAS DIRECTED BY.
>>Sundar Pichai: AND YOU CAN FOLLOW UP THAT WITH A QUESTION SHOW ME HIS WORDS. BECAUSE I FIND THAT NAME
VERY, VERY HARD TO PRONOUNCE. AND GOOGLE COULD PICK THAT CONVERSATION UP AND RETURN THE RIGHT ANSWER.
THIS HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN REALLY HARD TO DO FOR COMPUTERS. THE REASON WE ARE ABLE TO DO IT IS BECAUSE WE HAVE INVESTED THE LAST DECADE IN BUILDING THE WORLD'S BEST
NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY. IN OUR ABILITY TO DO CONVERSATIONAL UNDERSTANDING IS FAR AHEAD OF
WHAT OTHER ASSISTANTS CAN DO. ESPECIALLY IF YOU LOOK AT FOLLOW-ON QUERIES, OUR STUDIES SHOW THAT WE ARE AN
ORDER OF MAGNITUDE AHEAD OF EVERYONE ELSE. SO TODAY PEOPLE ARE USING GOOGLE AND ASKING US
QUESTIONS IN MANY, MANY DIFFERENT WAYS, SO WE'VE PUT TOGETHER A SHORT VIDEO SO THAT YOU CAN TAKE A LOOK.
[ VIDEO PLAYING ] [ MUSIC
] OKAY, GOOGLE., SHOW ME THE TRAILER FOR ANGRY BIRDS. >>> FIRE!
>>> HOW OLD IS THE TAJ MAHAL? WHOA. TAKE ME THERE.
>>> HERE ARE SOME HEADLINES. >>> WHAT'S PICASSO'S FULL
NAME? >>> PABLO DIEGO JOSÉ FRANCISCO DE PAULA JUAN NEPOMUCENO MARÍA DE LOS REMEDIOS CIPRIANO DE LA SANTÍSIMA TRINIDAD RUIZ Y
PICASSO. >>> YOU'RE ON THE FASTEST ROUTE. >>> PLAY LAUGHING OWL.
[ LAUGHING OWL ] >>> OKAY, GOOGLE., I'M ON A
THAT SELL. >>> HELLO. >>> SHOW ME MY GRADUATION PHOTOS.
>>> ON MY BLOG. >>> IT'S 29 DEGREES AND CLEAR. >>> YOUR ORDER HAS SHIPPED. >>> HERE ARE YOUR SCORES. [ VIDEO CONCLUDES
] [ CHEERS ] >>Sundar Pichai: AS YOU CAN SEE, USERS ARE ALREADY LOOKING TO GOOGLE TO GET -- TO HELP THEM GET THINGS DONE,
BUT WE BELIEVE WE ARE JUST GETTING STARTED. WE BELIEVE THIS IS A LONG JOURNEY AND GIVEN IT'S A JOURNEY, WE WANT
TO TALK TO YOU A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE FUTURE. WE WANT TO SHOW YOU THE KIND OF THINGS WE ASPIRE TO BE ABLE TO.
LET ME DO THAT WITH AN EXAMPLE. HERE'S A COMMON SITUATION. IT'S A FRIDAY NIGHT. I'M SURE MANY OF YOU CAN RELATE TO IT. BACK HOME, I WANT TO
TAKE MY FAMILY TO A MOVIE. YOU KNOW, YOU NORMALLY PULL OUT YOUR PHONE, RESEARCH MOVIES, LOOK AT THE REVIEWS,
FIND SHOWS NEARBY, AND TRY TO BOOK A TICKET. YOU KNOW, WE WANT TO BE THERE IN THESE MOMENTS HELPING YOU.
SO YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO ASK GOOGLE, "WHAT'S PLAYING TONIGHT?" AND BY THE WAY, TODAY, IF YOU ASK THAT
QUESTION, WE DO RETURN MOVIE RESULTS, BUT WE WANT TO GO A STEP FURTHER. WE WANT TO UNDERSTAND YOUR CONTEXT AND
MAYBE SUGGEST THREE RELEVANT MOVIES WHICH YOU WOULD LIKE NEARBY. I SHOULD BE ABLE TO LOOK AT
IT AND MAYBE TELL GOOGLE, "WE WANT TO BRING THE KIDS THIS TIME." AND THEN IF THAT'S THE CASE, GOOGLE SHOULD
REFINE THE ANSWER AND SUGGEST FAMILY-FRIENDLY OPTIONS. AND MAYBE EVEN ASK ME, "WOULD YOU LIKE FOUR TICKETS TO ANY
OF THESE?" AND IF I SAY, "SURE, LET'S DO
JUNGLE BOOK," IT SHOULD GO AHEAD AND GET THE TICKETS AND HAVE THEM READY WAITING FOR ME WHEN I NEED IT.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AS YOU CAN SEE, I ENGAGED IN
A CONVERSATION WITH GOOGLE AND IT HELPED ME GET THINGS DONE IN MY CONTEXT. AND BY THE WAY, THIS IS JUST
ONE VERSION OF THE CONVERSATION. THIS COULD HAVE GONE MANY, MANI' MANY, MANY
DIFFERENT WAYS. FOR EXAMPLE, WHEN GOOGLE RETURNED THE RESULTS, I COULD HAVE ASKED, "IS JUNGLE BOOK ANY GOOD?"
AND GOOGLE COULD HAVE GIVEN ME THE REVIEWS AND MAYBE EVEN SHOWN ME A TRAILER. AND BY THE WAY, I SAW THE MOVIE.
IT'S TERRIFIC. AND HOPE YOU GET TO SEE IT AS WELL. [ LAUGHTER ] EVERY SINGLE CONVERSATION IS
DIFFERENT. EVERY SINGLE CONTEXT IS DIFFERENT. AND WE ARE WORKING HARD TO DO THIS FOR BILLIONS OF
CONVERSATIONS, FOR BILLIONS OF USERS AROUND THE WORLD, FOR EVERYONE. WE THINK OF THE ASSISTANT AS
AN AMBIENT EXPERIENCE THAT EXTENDS ACROSS DEVICES. I THINK COMPUTING IS POISED TO EVOLVE BEYOND JUST PHONES.
IT WILL BE IN THE CONTEXT OF A USER'S DAILY LIFE. IT WILL BE ON THEIR PHONES, DEVICES THEY WEAR, IN THEIR CARS, AND
EVEN IN THEIR LIVING ROOMS. FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU'RE IN ONE
OF THE HUNDRED DIFFERENT ANDROID AUTO MODELS AND YOU'RE DRIVING AND YOU SAY, "LET'S HAVE CURRY TONIGHT,"
WE KNOW THE WARRIORS ARE TONIGHT AND STEPH CURRY IS PLAYING BUT YOU KNOW ALL YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS FOOD,
AND WE SHOULD BE SMART AND LET YOU KNOW WHEN IT IS READY
AND MAYBE EVEN HAVE IT WAITING FOR YOU AT YOUR HOME. TALKING ABOUT YOUR HOME, WE'VE ALREADY BUILT MANY,
MANY PRODUCTS FOR YOUR HOME. TODAY, WE HAVE SOLD OVER
25 MILLION CHROMECAST DEVICES, SO WE'VE BEEN THINKING HARD ABOUT HOW TO BRING THIS VISION OF GOOGLE
ASSISTANT INTO YOUR HOME. CREDIT TO THE TEAM AT AMAZON FOR CREATING A LOT OF EXCITEMENT IN THIS SPACE.
WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT OUR OWN UNIQUE APPROACH AND WE ARE GETTING READY TO LAUNCH SOMETHING LATER THIS YEAR.
TO GIVE YOU A PREVIEW, I'M GOING TO INVITE MARIO FROM THE CHROMECAST TEAM. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>>Mario Quieroz:
THANKS, SUNDAR. TODAY WE WANT TO GIVE YOU AN EARLY PREVIEW OF HOW WE'RE BRINGING THE GOOGLE
ASSISTANT TO THE HOME. OUR AS ASPIRATION IS TO MAKE
THE ASSISTANT USEFUL AND ENJOYABLE IN ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PLACES IN YOUR WORLD: WHERE YOU SPEND TIME WITH YOUR FAMILY. WHEN I
WALK INTO MY HOUSE, I WANT TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT, BUT I SHOULD BE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH IT IN A HANDS-FREEWAY, SIMPLY USING
MY VOICE WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE OUT MY PHONE. THIS IS WHY WE'RE CREATING GOOGLE HOME, A DEVICE WHICH
WILL BE AVAILABLE LATER THIS YEAR. GOOGLE HOME LETS YOU ENJOY
MUSIC AND ENTERTAINMENT THROUGHOUT YOUR ENTIRE HOUSE, MANAGE EVERYDAY TASKS MORE EASILY, AND ASK GOOGLE WHAT
YOU WANT TO KNOW. ALL OF THIS WILL BE DONE BY SPEAKING WITH THE ASSISTANT. IT WILL LET ANYONE IN THE
FAMILY, KIDS OR ADULTS, HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH GOOGLE. GOOGLE HOME IS UNMATCHED IN FAR-FIELD VOICE RECOGNITION
SINCE ITS POWERED BY MORE THAN TEN YEARS OF INNOVATION IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING.
I CAN CONTINUE THE TWO-WAY DIALOGUE WITH THE ASSISTANT THAT SUNDAR MENTIONED EARLIER, WHETHER I'M STANDING
NEARBY COOKING DINNER OR SITTING ACROSS THE ROOM PLAYING A GAME WITH MY DAUGHTER.
WITH GOOGLE HOME, WE SET OUT TO CREATE AND DESIGN A BEAUTIFUL PRODUCT THAT'S WARM AND INVITING AND FITS
NATURALLY IN MANY AREAS OF THE HOME. WE'RE DESIGNING THE TOP TO BLEND INTO YOUR HOME. WE'LL
GIVE YOU THE OPTION TO CUSTOMIZE THE BASE WITH DIFFERENT COLORS AND FINISHES, INCLUDING METAL AND
FABRIC TO REFLECT YOUR HOME'S STYLE, WHETHER IT BE IN THE LIVING ROOM, THE KITCHEN, OR THE
BEDROOM. WE'RE PUTTING A LOT OF CRAFTSMANSHIP INTO THE HARDWARE DESIGN, INCLUDING
THE LEDs'S PLACEMENT AND CHOREOGRAPHY, THE SPEAKER WHICH WILL FILL YOUR ROOM WITH MUSIC, THE MICROPHONE
SYSTEM, AND THE CLEAN FACE WITHOUT ANY
BUTTONS. . [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE
] THIS IS GOOGLE HOME! WE THINK IT WILL BE A BEAUTIFUL ADDITION TO ANY
ROOM IN YOUR HOUSE. AND WE'RE EVEN MORE EXCITED ABOUT WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO FOR
YOU. FIRST, MUSIC AND ENTERTAINMENT ARE A BIG PART OF WHAT MAKES BEING AT HOME
RELAXING AND FUN. NOT LONG AGO, WE INTRODUCED
CHROMECAST, DESIGNED TO PLAY YOUR FAVORITE SHOWS, MOVIES, AND YOUTUBE VIDEOS ON THE BIGGEST SCREEN IN YOUR HOUSE.
LAST YEAR, WE ADDED CHROMECAST AUDIO TO BRING THE EUSK YOU LOVE TO YOUR BEST SPEAKERS.
CHROMECAST HAS BEEN ONE OF THE HOTTEST-SELLING CONSUMER ELECTRONICS PRODUCTS SINCE THE DAY IT LAUNCHED, AND
GOOGLE HOME WILL BUILD ON THOSE EXPERIENCES. GOOGLE HOME IS A WI-FI SPEAKER THAT STREAMS MUSIC
DIRECTLY FROM THE CLOUD SO YOU GET THE HIGHEST QUALITY PLAYBACK. IT WILL DELIVER RICH BASS AND
CLEAR HIGHS ALL FROM A BEAUTIFUL, COMPACT FORM FACTOR. OF COURSE YOU CAN ACCESS
SONGS, PLAYLISTS, ALBUMS, ARTISTS, AND PODCASTS FROM
YOUR FAVORITE MUSIC SERVICES JUST BY ASKING WITH YOUR VOICE. OR IF YOU PREFER, YOU CAN
SEND MUSIC FROM YOUR ANDROID OR iOS DEVICE THROUGH
GOOGLE CAST. AND UNLIKE OTHER HOME ASSISTANTS, GOOGLE CAST SUPPORT ALLOWS YOU TO CONTROL OTHER SPEAKERS IN
YOUR HOME, WITHOUT COMPLICATED SETUP. SO WHEN YOU WANT TO LISTEN TO COLDPLAY IN THE LIVING ROOM
SPEAKERS, YOU CAN SIMPLY SAY, "PLAY VIVA LAVIDA" IN THE
LIVING ROOM AND IT WILL START PLAYING. CAST SUPPORT ALSO ENABLES MULTI-ROOM PLAYBACK SO YOU CAN ADD ONE OR MORE
GOOGLE HOME DEVICES TO A GROUP OF SPEAKERS AND REALLY BLAST YOUR FAVORITE TUNES. AND IT LETS YOU CONTROL YOUR
VIDEO CONTENT, TOO. LET'S SAY THAT YOU WANT TO WATCH THAT EPISODE OF JIMMY KIMMEL OR THE TRENDING YOUTUBE VIDEO
ON YOUR TV. JUST TELL GOOGLE HOME, AND THE CONTENT WILL APPEAR ON THE BIGGEST, BRIGHTEST SCREEN IN YOUR
HOUSE. NEXT, GOOGLE HOME WILL BECOME
MORE AND MORE OF A CONTROL CENTER FOR YOUR WHOLE HOME. HOME IS WHERE LOTS OF DAILY TASKS JUST NEED TO GET DONE.
HAVING ACCESS TO THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT MAKES THIS A LOT EASIER. IT'S LIKE HAVING A VOICE-ACTIVATED REMOTE
CONTROL TO THE REAL WORLD WHENEVER YOU NEED IT. YOU CAN DO THE BASICS LIKE SETTING ALARMS AND TIMERS OR
MANAGING TO-DO LISTS AND SHOPPING LISTS. WE'RE ALSO
DESIGNING GOOGLE HOME TO CONNECT YOUR SMART HOME SEAMLESSLY. IT WILL SUPPORT THE MOST POPULAR HOME
NETWORKING SYSTEMS SO THAT YOU CAN EASILY CONTROL YOUR LIGHTS, THERMOSTATS, SWITCHES, AND MORE, INCLUDING
OUR OWN NEST DEVICES. FURTHER IN THE FUTURE, WE'LL WORK WITH DEVELOPERS TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO CONTROL THINGS
BEYOND THE HOME, LIKE BOOKING A CAR, ORDERING DINNER, OR SENDING FLOWERS TO MOM, AND MUCH, MUCH MORE, ALL WITH
JUST YOUR VOICE. THIRD, GOOGLE HOME LETS YOU
ASK GOOGLE ABOUT ANYTHING YOU WANT TO KNOW. OF COURSE YOU CAN GET THE BASICS LIKE THE WEATHER OR FACTS THAT YOU
MIGHT FIND ON WIKIPEDIA. BUT WHAT MAKES GOOGLE HOME REALLY SHINE IS THAT IT HAS SEARCH BUILT IN.
IT DRAWS ON 17 YEARS OF INNOVATION IN ORGANIZING THE
WORLD'S INFORMATION TO ANSWER QUESTIONS WHICH ARE DIFFICULT FOR OTHER ASSISTANTS TO HANDLE. YOU MIGHT ASK: HOW
MUCH FAT IS IN AN AVOCADO? OR: WHAT IS DRAYMOND GREEN'S
JERSEY NUMBER? AND THEN FOLLOW-UP THAT LAST QUESTION WITH WHERE DID HE GO TO COLLEGE? OR TRY SOMETHING
MORE COMPLEX. WHAT WAS THE U.S. POPULATION WHEN NASA WAS ESTABLISHED? YOU'LL GET IMMEDIATE,
ACCURATE ANSWERS FROM GOOGLE EACH TIME. AND THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT NOT ONLY KNOWS A LOT ABOUT THE
WORLD, BUT IT WILL STAND APART IN HOW IT CAN ALSO GET TO KNOW YOU OVER TIME. WITH YOUR PERMISSION, OF COURSE.
IT CAN HELP YOU RETRIEVE YOUR TRAVEL ITINERARY, YOUR DAILY SCHEDULE, YOUR TRAFFIC TO WORK, YOUR PACKAGE DELIVERY
INFORMATION, AND MUCH MORE. AND AS GOOGLE KEEPS GETTING BETTER, SO WILL GOOGLE HOME. SO THAT'S GOOGLE HOME. A
BEAUTIFUL, SMART, VOICE-ENABLED ASSISTANT FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY. ENJOY MUSIC AND ENTERTAINMENT
THROUGHOUT YOUR ENTIRE HOUSE, MANAGE EVERYDAY TASKS EFFORTLESSLY, AND ASK GOOGLE WHAT YOU WANT TO KNOW.
IT'S EARLY DAYS, BUT WE WANT TO GIVE YOU AND SHOW YOU HOW WE ENVISION THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT COMING TO LIFE AT
HOME. WE CREATED A SHORT VIDEO TO BRING THE PRODUCT INTO A FAMILY SETTING TO CAPTURE WHAT IT MIGHT BE LIKE
IN THE FUTURE TO HAVE YOUR PERSONAL GOOGLE AROUND THE HOUSE. LET'S ROLL THE VIDEO.
[ VIDEO PLAYING ] >>> OKAY, GOOGLE. PLAY THE
MORNING PLAYLIST. >>Google: OKAY. PLAYING MORNING PLAYLIST. [ MUSIC ]
>>> OKAY, GOOGLE, PLAY MUSIC IN ALL ROOMS. [ MUSIC
] >>> OKAY, GOOGLE, I'M LISTENING. >>Google: YOUR FLIGHT TO PORTLAND IS DELAYED BY 30 MINUTES.
>>> CHANGE MY DINNER RESERVATION TONIGHT FROM SEVEN TO EIGHT. >>Google: YOUR RESERVATION AT ANDINA IS NOW CONFIRMED FOR 8:00 P.M.
>>> HEY, GOOGLE, TEXT LOUISE, FLIGHT DELAYED, DINNER MOVED TO 8:00. >>Google: OKAY. MESSAGE
SENT. >>> GOOD MORNING. >>> MORNING. >>> HEY, GOOGLE, TURN THE LIGHTS ON IN KEVIN'S ROOM. >>> I THOUGHT YOU FINISHED
THAT ALREADY. >>> UM, I FORGOT. OKAY, GOOGLE, WHAT'S APPLES IN SPANISH?
>>Google: MANZANAS. >>> HEY, GOOGLE, HAS MY PACKAGE SHIPPED? >>Google: YES, IT'S ALREADY
SHIPPED. IT WILL ARRIVE TOMORROW. >>> OH, IS THAT FOR ME? >>> MAYBE. >>> INTERESTING. >>> OKAY, GOOGLE, HOW MANY
STARS ARE IN OUR GALAXY? >>Google: WELL, THERE ARE ABOUT 100 TO 400 BILLION STAIRS ACCORDING TO
SPACE.COM. >>> WHICH STAR IS THE CLOSEST? >>Google: ACCORDING TO NASA, THE NEAREST STAR SYSTEM IS ALPHA CENTAURI.
>>> CAN YOU XIAOMI WHAT IT SHOW ME WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE ON THE TV? >>> OKAY, GOOGLE, HOW IS
TRAFFIC FROM PEBBLE ROCK SCHOOL TO THE AIRPORT? >>Google: YOUR NORMAL ROUTE
HAS HEAVY TRAFFIC. THERE'S A FASTER ONE THAT WILL TAKE ABOUT 35 MINUTES. I'VE SENT IT TO YOUR PHONE.
>>> OKAY. LET'S GO. >>> DAD?
>>> HEY, GOOGLE, WHAT'S ON THE CALENDAR TODAY? >>Google: THE FIRST EVENT IS SPACE DAY AT KEVIN'S SCHOOL. IT STARTS AT 8:00 A.M. >>> SPACE DAY. ARE YOU
READY, BUDDY? >>> READY. >>> LET'S GO. [ VIDEO CONCLUDES.
>>> OKAY, GOOGLE. GOOD-BYE. >>Google: GOOD-BYE.
[ VIDEO CONCLUDES ] [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE
] >>Mario Quieroz: WE'RE REALLY, REALLY EXCITED ABOUT WHAT'S AHEAD. GOOGLE HOME
WILL BE AVAILABLE LATER THIS YEAR. IN THE MEANTIME, TO STAY UP-TO-DATE WITH THE LATEST NEWS, PLEASE SIGN UP
AT GOOGLE.COM/HOME. WE WANTED TO SHARE THIS EARLY PREVIEW AT I/O SO THAT WE CAN WORK WITH PARTNERS IN A MORE
OPEN WAY TO DELIVER AWESOME EXPERIENCES AT LAUNCH. WE'LL HAVE A LOT MORE TO SHARE SOON WITH THE DEVELOPER COMMUNITY
ABOUT HOW TO BEGIN TO INTEGRATE WITH THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT. AND WITH THAT, LET ME ASK
SUNDAR BACK ON STAGE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE
] >>Sundar Pichai: THANK YOU, MARIO. IT'S REALLY EXCITING TO SEE THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT COME TO LIFE WITH GOOGLE HOME
AND TO HELP PEOPLE GET THINGS DONE. TO DO THIS WELL AS MARIO MENTIONED, WE REALLY NEED TO WORK WITH DEVELOPERS
AND THIRD PARTIES SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE THESE ACTIONS FOR OUR USERS. WE ALREADY DO THIS A LOT AT
GOOGLE TODAY. USING GOOGLE PRODUCTS, YOU CAN ALREADY BOOK A MOVIE TICKET WITH FANDANGO, GET A CAR WITH
UBER, LISTEN TO MUSIC ON SPOTIFY, BOOK A RESTAURANT WITH OPENTABLE, MAYBE RECORD A RIDE WITH STRAVA, AND MANY,
MANY MORE SUCH USE CASES. SO WE ARE THINKING ABOUT THIS THOUGHTFULLY, AND WE'RE WORKING ON A COMPREHENSIVE
WAY BY WHICH THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS CAN INTERACT WITH THE ASSISTANT, AND WE'LL BE SHARING A LOT MORE IN THE
UPCOMING MONTHS. I TALKED EARLIER THAT WE ARE WORKING HARD AT CORE USE CASES ON MOBILE. ONE SUCH
IMPORTANT USE CASE IS PHOTOS. LAST YEAR, THANKS TO THE
ADVANCES IN COMPUTER VISION, WE APPROACHED PHOTOS WITH A NEW PERSPECTIVE. WE ANNOUNCED GOOGLE PHOTO AT
GOOGLE I/O LAST YEAR WITH THE GOAL TO HELP USERS FIND AND ORGANIZE THEIR PHOTOS AND VIDEOS, KEEP THEM SAFE, AND
SHARE THEM EFFORTLESSLY WITH THEIR FAMILY AND FRIENDS ON ANY DEVICE. WE'VE SEEN TREMENDOUS
ADOPTION WITH GOOGLE PHOTOS, AND JUST IN THE PAST YEAR, WE HAVE SEEN TREMENDOUS ADOPTION, AND TODAY WE ARE AT
OVER 200 MILLION MONTHLY ACTIVE USERS. [ APPLAUSE ] OUR COMPUTER VISION SYSTEMS
HAVE AUTOMATICALLY APPLIED OVER 2 TRILLION LABELS. THIS
IS WHAT ALLOWS US, WHEN YOU SEARCH FOR POMERANIAN, TO
FIND THE RIGHT PICTURE. AND BY THE WAY, OVER 24 BILLION OF THOSE LABELS ARE FOR SELFIES.
[ LAUGHTER ] WE EVEN HAVE POMERANIAN SELFIES. [ LAUGHTER ]
GOOGLE PHOTOS SHOWS WHAT'S POSSIBLE WHEN YOU APPROACH AN EXISTING AREA FROM A NEW PERSPECTIVE.
ANOTHER CORE USE CASE ON USERS' PHONES IS COMMUNICATIONS. IT'S AN EXCITING AREA, AND THERE IS A
LOT OF INNOVATION. BUT GIVEN OUR ADVANCEMENTS IN MACHINE
LEARNING, WE WANTED TO APPROACH THIS CORE USE CASE WITH A NEW PERSPECTIVE. ERIK KAY IS GOING TO JOIN TO TALK
TO YOU MORE ABOUT IT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE
>>Erik Kay: ] THANKS, SUNDAR. YOU KNOW, COMMUNICATIONS IS
ALL ABOUT SHARING LIFE'S MOMENTS. THAT GREAT RESTAURANT I FOUND, THE WINNING SHOT IN OVERTIME, MY
DAUGHTER'S RECITAL. TODAY I CAN SHARE MOMENTS LIKE THESE THE SECOND THEY HAPPEN, JUST BY PULLING OUT MY PHONE AND
SENDING A MESSAGE. COMMUNICATIONS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR LIVES, AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT FOCUS
FOR GOOGLE AS WELL. WHAT MAKES ME PERSONALLY EXCITED ABOUT COMMUNICATIONS IS THE POTENTIAL FOR INNOVATION WHEN
YOU COMBINE THE POWER OF MOBILE WITH ADVANCEMENTS IN MACHINE LEARNING. SO TODAY WE'RE GIVING YOU A
LOOK AT WHAT WE'VE BEEN UP TO WITH TWO NEW COMMUNICATION APPS THAT SHOW WHAT'S POSSIBLE WHEN WE BRING GOOGLE
TECHNOLOGY TO THIS ESSENTIAL HUMAN ACTIVITY. THE FIRST IS A NEW MESSAGING APP CALLED ALLO.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU.
ALLO IS A SMART MESSAGING APP. IT LEARNS OVER TIME TO MAKE CONVERSATIONS EASIER, MORE EXPRESSIVE, AND MORE
PRODUCTIVE BY BRINGING ALL THE RICHNESS OF GOOGLE RIGHT INTO YOUR CHAT. ALLO IS BASED ON YOUR PHONE NUMBER SO
YOU CAN EASILY GET IN TOUCH WITH ANYONE IN YOUR PHONE BOOK. THIS MORNING, WE'RE GOING TO
WALK YOU THROUGH THREE AREAS THAT MAKE ALLO REALLY SPECIAL. FIRST ARE SOME WAYS TO EXPRESS YOURSELF AND KEEP
THE CONVERSATION GOING. THEN, WE'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO HAVE THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT BUILT RIGHT INTO
YOUR MESSAGING APP. AND, FINALLY, WE'LL TELL YOU HOW ALLO KEEPS YOUR CONVERSATIONS PRIVATE AND SECURE. SO LET'S
GET STARTED. ON THE STAGE WITH ME TO HELP
DEMO IS AMIT. HE LEADS PRODUCT MANAGEMENT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND ON THE SCREEN BEHIND ME
YOU CAN SEE AMIT'S IN A CHAT -- IN A CONVERSATION WITH HIS FRIEND JOY. SO WE DESIGNED ALLO TO HELP YOU
EXPRESS YOURSELF AND KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING. SO, OF COURSE, THERE'S A GREAT SELECTION OF STICKERS WHICH
WE'VE SOURCED FROM INDEPENDENT ARTISTS AND CONTENT PRODUCERS FROM AROUND THE WORLD. BUT EXPRESSION IS
MORE THAN JUST EMOJIS AND STICKERS. SO WE'VE ADDED MORE FEATURES THAT HELP YOU SAY WHAT YOU MEAN. FIRST,
LET'S LOOK AT WHISPER SHOUT. WE WANTED TO GIVE YOU A WAY
TO ADD MORE EMOTION TO YOUR WORDS. SOMETIMES YOU WANT TO GET YOUR POINT ACROSS BIG AND BOLD. OTHER TIMES YOU %%%CHUCK{^P|START}START WANT TO SAY THINGS A BIT MORE
SOFTLY. WHISPER SHOUT LET'S YOU EXPREPS HOW EXPRESS HOW YOU REALLY FEEL
BY MAKING YOUR REPLIES VERY BIG OR VERY SMALL. AMIT, CAN YOU SHOW EVERYONE HOW THAT WORKS?
SO AMIT HAS TYPED "YAY" AND THRONE A SMILEY
THROWN A SMILEY FACE IN THERE. RATHER THAN HITTING THE TAP BUTTON, HE SLIDES THE BUTTON DOWN TO WHISPER AND UP
TO SHOUT. DOWN TO WHISPER AND UP AGAIN TO SHOUT. [ APPLAUSE ]
I THINK IT'S PRETTY COOL, TOO. NO MORE YELLING IN ALL CAPS TO GET YOUR POINT ACROSS.
IT'S ALSO FUN TO ADD EMOTION TO YOUR PHOTOS. AND INK LET'S YOU GET CREATIVE WITH THE PHOTOS YOU SEND. AMIT'S
PICKED A PHOTO OF HIS ADORABLE BABY GIRL AND WROTE AHOY ON THE LITTLE SAILOR. POSTED IT. IT'S THAT SIMPLE.
I USE INK ALL THE TIME. IT'S REALLY FUN. ANOTHER WAY ALLO HELPS YOU EXPRESS YOURSELF IS BY LETTING YOU TYPE LESS, A
LOT LESS. WE'VE TAKEN A PAGE FROM THE INBOX PLAYBOOK AND
BUILT SMART REPLY RIGHT INTO YOUR CHAT CONVERSATIONS. [ APPLAUSE ]
THIS IS ESPECIALLY POWERFUL IN MESSAGING WHEN YOU'RE ON THE GO. SO NOW YOU CAN KEEP YOUR CONVERSATIONS GOING WITH
JUST A QUICK TAP. SO YOU CAN SEE WHEN JOY ASKS: DINNER LATER? THAT AMIT HAS OFFERED TWO SMART REPLY SUGGESTIONS:
I'M BUSY AND I'M IN! OKAY. I PROMISE I WON'T ACT OUT ANY
MORE EMOJIS. [ LAUGHTER ] SO ALLO USES MACHINE LEARNING TO SUGGEST REPLIES ON THE
FLY, ANTICIPATING WHAT YOU MIGHT WANT TO SAY NEXT. NOW, THESE AREN'T JUST CANNED REPLIES. ALLO LEARNS OVER
TIME AND WILL SUGGEST RESPONSES BASED ON HOW YOU LIKE TO EXPRESS YOURSELF. THE MORE YOU USE ALLO THE
BETTER THE SUGGESTIONS WILL BECOME. SO THE SUGGESTIONS YOU SEE ARE UNIQUE TO YOU. YOU CAN SAY THE THINGS YOU
WANT WITHOUT HAVING TO TYPE A SINGLE WORD. AND SINCE MESSAGING ISN'T JUST ABOUT TEXT, SMART REPLIES CONTAIN
STICKERS AND EMOJIS, TOO, BECAUSE AS THEY SAY, AN EMOJI'S WORTH A THOUSAND WORDS. DO THEY SAY THAT?
[ LAUGHTER ] NOW I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING REALLY COOL. ALLO EVEN OFFERS SMART REPLIES
WHEN PEOPLE SEND PHOTOS TO YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
THIS WORKS BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO UNDERSTANDING TEXT, ALLO BUILDS ON GOOGLE'S COMPUTER VISION CAPABILITIES
TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE CONTENT AND THE CONTEXT OF IMAGES. IN THIS CASE, ALLO UNDERSTOOD THAT THE PICTURE
WAS OF A DOG, THAT IT WAS A CUTE DOG, AND EVEN THE BREED OF THE DOG. IN OUR INTERNAL TESTING, WE FOUND THAT ALLO
IS 90% ACCURATE IN DETERMINING WHETHER A DOG
DESERVES THE "CUTE DOG" RESPONSE. [ LAUGHTER ] SO LET'S TRY SOMETHING EVEN
HARDER. WHEN JOY SENDS A PHOTO OF PASTA, WE'RE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE PRECISE DETAILS OF THE IMAGE AND CREATE SMART
REPLIES MENTION MENTIONING BOTH LINGUINI AND THE CLAMS.
WHAT'S REALLY COOL HERE IS WE DON'T JUST IDENTIFY WHAT'S IN THE IMAGE. SMART REPLY ACTUALLY CREATES A CONVERSATIONAL RESPONSE, SOMETHING LIKE "YUMMY," THE
KIND OF THING YOU WOULD ACTUALLY SAY IN RESPONSE TO A PHOTO OF FOOD. THIS IS ONLY POSSIBLE BECAUSE WE'VE
MARRIED OUR STRENGTHS IN COMPUTER VISION AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING. AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THERE'S A
LOT OF COMPLEX TECHNOLOGY AT WORK HERE JUST TO HELP YOU SAY SOMETHING AS FUN -- AS SIMPLE AND NATURAL AS "I LOVE
LINGUINI." SO, THAT'S A LITTLE HOW ALLO HELPS YOU EXPRESS YOURSELF AND KEEP YOUR CONVERSATIONS GOING.
THE INTELLIGENCE BEHIND SMART REPLY ALSO GIVES YOU A TASTE AT HOW ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGY CAN MAKE YOUR MESSAGE
EXPERIENCE SIMPLER AND MORE PRODUCTIVE. THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT BUILT RIGHT INTO ALLO TAKES IT EVEN FARTHER,
SO I'M PLEASED TO INTRODUCE ONE OF OUR LEADS, REBECCA, TO TELL YOU MORE ABOUT THE ASSISTANT IN ALLO.
[ APPLAUSE ] >>Rebecca Michael: THANKS, ERIK. AS YOU HEARD EARLIER, THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT IS AN OP
GOING DIALOG BETWEEN YOU AND GOOGLE THAT HELPS YOU GET THINGS DONE IN YOUR WORLD. IT'S ALSO DESIGNED AS AN
AMBIENT EXPERIENCE. IT'S THERE FOR YOU WHENEVER YOU NEED IT. AND IN MESSAGING THAT REALLY MEANS BRINGING
THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT RIGHT INTO YOUR CONVERSATION WITH FRIENDS. SO I'M GOING TO SHOW YOU HOW THE ASSISTANT
CAN HELP IN AMIT'S AND JOY'S CONVERSATION. SO THEY'RE PLANNING A DINNER AND JOY NOW SAYS SHE WOULD LIKE ITALIAN
FOOD. THE ASSISTANT INTELLIGENTLY RECOGNIZES THAT THEY COULD USE SOME TIPS FOR ITALIAN RESTAURANTS NEAR AND
YOU CAN SEE IT'S PROACTIVE SUGGESTIONS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SCREEN. TAPPING THIS BRINGS UP RESTAURANT CARDS
THAT EVERYONE IN THE CHAT CAN SEE. THESE ARE POWERED GUY GOOGLE'S KNOWLEDGE GRAPH WHICH MEANS THAT ALLO CAN HELP WITH ALL KINDS OF
INFORMATION IN THE REAL WORLD WORLD. SO THERE'S SOME BACK AND FORTH ABOUT WHICH RESTAURANT TO GO TO. IT
LOOKS LIKE THEY'RE LEANING TOWARDS CUCINA AT 7:00. SO AMIT TAPS ON THE RESTAURANT CARD TO BRING UP MORE
DETAILS. LOOKS GOOD. SERVES PASTA WHICH WE KNOW JOY FANCIED. SO AMIT CAN NOW GO AHEAD AND MAKE A RESERVATION
RIGHT THERE THROUGH OPEN TABLE. THE ASSISTANT PROMPTS HIM TO CONFIRM THE NUMBER OF DINERS AND WHAT TIME THEY
WANT TO EAT. AND NOW THEY'RE BOOKED AND READY TO GO.
SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE -- [ LAUGHTER ] WHAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IS COMPLETELY NEW. IN THE PAST,
AMIT WOULD HAVE HAD TO LEAVE THE CHAT TO DO A GOOGLE SEARCH, RETURN WITH SOME RESTAURANT OPTIONS, SWITCH
BACK AGAIN TO SHARE THE OPTIONS, GO OUT AGAIN TO MAKE THE RESERVATION AT OPEN TABLE AND THEN COME BACK IN TO
SHARE THE DETAILS WITH THE REST OF THE GROUP. IN ALLO, AMIT AND JOY CAN CHOOSE AND RESERVE A RESTAURANT RIGHT
THERE IN THE CHAT AND IN A NATURAL AND SEAMLESS WAY.
[ APPLAUSE ]
SO OPEN TABLE WILL BE JUST ONE OF THE MANY PARTNERS THAT WILL BE PART OF THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT ECOSYSTEM, AND WE
CAN'T WAIT TO SHARE MORE SOON WITH THE DEVELOPER COMMUNITY ABOUT HOW TO GET STARTED. [ APPLAUSE ]
COOL. SO WE SAW SOME PROACTIVE SUGGESTIONS FROM GOOGLE THERE. YOU CAN ALSO CALL ON THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT
DIRECTLY AT ANY TIME JUST BY TYPING @GOOGLE AS AMIT'S DOING NOW. AND HE'S GOING TO ASK FOR
FUNNY CAT PICS. REALLY, AMIT? OKAY. COOL. SO
GOOGLE OBLIGES, OF COURSE, WITH A LOVELY LINEUP OF CATS
FROM GOOGLE IMAGE SEARCH. WOW, THAT CHIN. OKAY. SO YOU JUST SAW HOW THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT CAN BE
REALLY HELPFUL IN GROUPS. YOU CAN ALSO HAVE A ONE ON ONE CHAT WITH GOOGLE. WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS AMIT'S
CONTACT LIST AND GOOGLE'S APPEARING AT THE TOP THERE. SO LET'S JUMP IN AND HAVE A CHAT. JUST LIKE WITH ANY
OTHER CONVERSATION, THIS ONE PICKS UP RIGHT WHERE YOU LEFT OFF AND THE ASSISTANT WILL REMEMBER THINGS LIKE YOUR
NAME AND EVEN TELL YOU HOW IT'S FEELING. LET'S TRY SOMETHING MORE INTERESTING. AMIT'S A BIG REAL MADRID FAN
AND HE WANTS TO NOW HOW THEY GOT ON IN THEIR LAST MATCH. WE WILL ASK THE ASSISTANT: DID MY TEAM WIN? IT LOOKS
LIKE THEY DID. THEY WON THEIR -- YEAH. SO REAL MADRID FANS OUT THERE. [ APPLAUSE ]
COOL. AND SO THEY WON THEIR LAST MATCH ON SATURDAY. LET'S SEE WHEN THEY ARE PLAYING
NEXT. THAT'S PRETTY COOL. THEY ARE THROUGH THE CHAMPION'S LEAGUE FINAL AT THE END OF THE MONTH. WE CAN
KEEP GOING LIKE THIS AND FIND MORE NEWS ABOUT THE TEAM JUST BY TAPPING ON THE SUGGESTIONS THERE. BUT LET'S GO AHEAD
AND TAP ON THEIR ROSTER. THERE WE GO. WE HAVE A
CAROUSEL WITH ALL THEIR TOP TALENT AND SHOULD WE CHECK OUT EVERYONE'S FAVORITE?
MR. RONALDO. LET'S SEE SOME OF HIS BEST TRICKS.
SO AMIT ONLY HAS TO TYPE "BEST TRICKS" AND THE
ASSISTANT UNDERSTANDS THE CONTEXT AND THAT HE MEANS RONALDO'S BEST TRICKS AND RESPONDS WITH A YouTUBE VIDEO. [ APPLAUSE ]
WE WON'T PLAY THAT VIDEO NOW, BUT IF WE DID TAP IT, IT WOULD PLAY RIGHT THERE IN THE CHAT.
SO, LET'S PLAY A GAME INSTEAD. AMIT'S ASKING GOOGLE TO PLAY A GAME. AND, OKAY. GOOGLE'S SUGGESTING
THE INC. EMOJI GAME. THE WAY THIS WORKS GOOGLE PROVIDES A STRING OF EMOJI AND YOU HAVE
TO GUESS THE FILM TITLE. ARE YOU READY?
>>> YES! >>Rebecca Michael: YEAH? LET'S PLAY! OKAY. SO LOOKS LIKE WE'VE
GOT A CROWN AND SOME RINGS. ANY IDEAS?
>>> LORD OF THE RINGS. >>Rebecca Michael: I HEAR THE PRINCESS BRIDE OVER THERE. AMIT, ANY IDEAS?
LORD OF THE RINGS. OH, IT WAS TOO EASY. OKAY. WE COULD KEEP GOING BUT I THINK YOU GOT THE IDEA. SO THAT
WAS OBVIOUSLY -- [ LAUGHTER ] SHOULD WE KEEP GOING? NO. ANY IDEAS?
THEY'RE GOOD. OKAY. SO THIS IS OBVIOUSLY A SUPER SIM MEL GAME AND SIMPLE GAME AND THERE'S
A BUNCH MORE YOU CAN PLAY IN ALLO. WE REALLY THINK THE BEST GAMES WILL COME FROM THE DEVELOPER COMMUNITY. SO -- [ APPLAUSE ]
SO THAT WAS THE ASSISTANT IN ALLO. ALLOWING YOU TO HARNESS ALL OF THE RICHNESS AND KNOWLEDGE FROM GOOGLE FROM
SEARCH, YouTUBE'S, MAPS, PHOTOS AS WELL AS MANY OF OUR PARTNERS TO HAVE FUN AND GET THINGS DONE. AS YOU SAW, THE
INTERFACE IS INHERENTLY PERSONAL AND CONVERSATIONAL AND THE SMART SUGGESTIONS CHIP HELP TO KEEP THE
CONVERSATION FLOWING. MOST IMPORTANTLY FOR THE FIRST TIME, YOU CAN USE GOOGLE IN YOUR CHATS WITH YOUR FRIENDS.
AND WITH THAT, I'LL HAND IT BACK TO ERIK. [ APPLAUSE ] >>Erik Kay: THANKS, REBECCA.
AND THANKS, AMIT. I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES THAT GOOGLE ASSISTANT BRINGS TO
MESSAGING. NOW LET'S TALK A BIT ABOUT PRIVACY AND SECURITY. WE REALIZE THAT SOMETIMES PEOPLE
WANT TO BE INCOGNITO. OF COURSE, THIS APPLIES TO CHAT
AS WELL. SO, FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF CHROME, WE'VE CREATED AN INCOGNITO MODE FOR ALLO. WHILE ALL
MESSAGES IN ALLO ARE ENCRYPTED, CHATS IN INCOGNITO MODE ARE END-TO-END ENCRYPTED. INCOGNITO CHATS
HAVE DISCEET NOTIFICATIONS BEHINDING THE SENDERS AND
SHOULDER SURFERS AND PRYING EYES. INCOGNITO ALSO OFFERS MESSAGE EXPIRATION SO YOU'RE IN CONTROL OF HOW LONG YOUR
PRIVATE MESSAGES STICK AROUND. AND SIMILAR TO WHEN YOU CLOSE AN INCOGNITO WINDOW IN CHROME, WHEN YOU DELETE AN
INCOGNITO CONVERSATION IN ALLO, IT'S GONE FOREVER AND NO ONE CAN SEE IT AGAIN ON YOUR DEVICE. WITH INCOGNITO
MODE, ALLO GIVES PIEWFERS USERS ADDITIONAL CONTROLS OVER THEIR PRIVACY AND SECURITY
AND WE ANTICIPATE ADDING EVEN MORE SECURITY FEATURES TO IT OVER TIME. SO THAT'S ALLO. ALLO IS
FAST, SMART, AND SECURE AND IT LET'S YOU EXPRESS YOURSELF IN FUN NEW WAYS. AND ALLO WILL BE THE FIRST HOME FOR
THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT AS IT STARTS TO TAKE SHAPE, BRINGING THE RICHNESS OF GOOGLE RIGHT INTO YOUR CHATS.
NOW, ALLO IS ALL ABOUT MESSAGING BUT LET ME TALK TO
YOU A MINUTE ABOUT VIDEO CALLING. JUST AS TECHNOLOGY HAS HELPED CONNECT PEOPLE THROUGH MESSAGING, VIDEO
CALLING HAS BROUGHT FAMILIES AND FRIENDS TOGETHER FROM AROUND THE WORLD. IT CAN BE A MAGICAL EXPERIENCE, SO WHY
DON'T WE PICK UP THE PHONE AND DO IT MORE OFTEN? WELL, MAYBE THE OTHER PERSON HAS A DIFFERENT KIND OF PHONE.
MAYBE THE CONNECTION IS A LITTLE SPOTTY. AND EVEN WHEN IT DOES WORK, GETTING A CALL CAN OFTEN FEEL INTRUSIVE
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT QUITE SURE WHY THE OTHER PERSON'S CALLING. THAT'S WHY WE CHALLENGED
OURSELVES TO DESIGN A VIDEO CALLING EXPERIENCE THAT WOULD FEEL MAGICAL EVERY TIME. SO, I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO
DUO., A SIMPLE ONE-TO-ONE CALLING APP FOR EVERYONE.
[ APPLAUSE ] DUO IS THE VIDEO COMPANION TO ALLO. IT'S FAST AND PERFORMS
WELL EVEN ON SLOW NETWORKS. IT'S END-TO-END ENCRYPTED. IT'S BASED ON YOUR PHONE NUMBER ALLOWING YOU TO EASILY
GET IN TOUCH WITH THE PEOPLE YOU CARE ABOUT AND IT WORKS ON BOTH ANDROID AND iOS. BUT HERE'S A FEATURE THAT
MAKES ALLO REALLY SPECIAL. WE CALL IT KNOCK KNOCK.
KNOCK KNOCK SHOWS YOU A LIVE VIDEO STREAM OF THE CALLER BEFORE YOU'VE EVEN PICKED UP. NOT ONLY CAN YOU SEE WHO'S
CALLING BUT WHAT THEY'RE UP TO AND WHY THEY'RE CALLING, A SMILE, A BEACH, A NEWBORN BABY CAN ALL DRAW YOU INTO
THE MOMENT, MAKING CALLS FEEL SPONTANEOUS AND NATURAL. AND ONCE YOU PICK UP, DUO PUTS YOU RIGHT INTO THE CALL
SEAMLESSLY TRANSITIONING FROM THE LIVE PREVIEW TO THE LIVE CALL. KNOCK KNOCK TOTALLY CHANGES WHAT IT'S LIKE TO
RECEIVE A VIDEO CALL. SO LET'S TAKE A
LOOK. AND ALMOST RIGHT ON CUE, I'M GETTING A CALL FROM MY DAUGHTER AVA. I USE EYE HAVE A AVA FOR ALL MY DEMOS.
[ LAUGHTER ] SO AS YOU CAN SEE, AND ELENA APPARENTLY, TOO, IS POPPING IN THERE, I HAVEN'T EVEN
PICKED UP YET BUT AVA IS RIGHT THERE SMILING AND MAKING FUNNY FACES. I CAN TELL SHE IS REALLY EAGER TO
TALK. SO LET'S ANSWER IT. >>> HI, DAD. >>Erik Kay: HI, AVA, HI, ELENA.
>>> ARE YOU DONE WITH YOUR PRESENTATION YET? >>Erik Kay: ALMOST. I'LL BE DONE SOON. WITH YOU WAVE TO
EVERYBODY? >>> HI, EVERYBODY. [ APPLAUSE ] ERIK KAY K >>Erik Kay: I'LL
TALK TO YOU SOON. >>> BYE, DAD. [ LAUGHTER ]
>>Erik Kay: OOPS.
SO YOU JUST SAW HOW KNOCK KNOCK DREW US INTO THE CONVERSATION WITH AVA AND ELENA BEFORE WE EVEN PICKED
IT UP AND HOW FAST AND SMOOTH IT WAS. NOW, KNOCK KNOCK ONLY WORKS WHEN THE VIDEO IS INSTANT. THERE CAN'T BE A
GAP BETWEEN THE PHONE RINGING AND THE VIDEO APPEARING. THIS IS A REALLY HARD TEXAS
TECHNICAL PROBLEM BUT WE'RE UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO TACKLE IT. DUO WAS BUILT BY THE TEAM THAT WAS CREATED WEBRTC
THE OPEN SOURCE PLATFORM THAT NOW POWERS MUCH OF TODAY'S MOBILE VIDEO COMMUNICATION. WE KNOW THEY TECHNOLOGY LIKE NO ONE ELSE. WE USED A NEW PROTOCOL
CALLED QUIC THAT ALLOWS DUO TO ESTABLISH AN ENCRYPTED CONNECTION IN A SINGLE ROUND TRIP. WE OBSESSED OVER EVERY
LAST DETAIL OF VIDEO TRANSMISSION, HAND TUNING AND OPTIMIZING CODECS, BANDWIDTH PROBING, ENCRYPTION AND MORE.
THE RESULT IS THE UNIQUE FEEL OF KNOCK KNOCK. YOU'RE RIGHT THERE IN AN
INSTANT. SO THE OTHER THING THAT REALLY SETS DUO APART IS HOW RELIABLE IT MAKES VIDEO
CALLING. DUO WORKS WHEREVER YOU ARE, WHETHER IT'S NEW YORK OR NEW DELHI, BUENOS AIRES OR BUTTE, AT
HOME OR ON THE ROAD. DUO PROACTIVELY MONITORS NETWORK
QUALITY MULTIPLE TIMES PER SECOND, ALLOWING IT TO DEGRADE GRACEFULLY WHEN BANDWIDTH IS LIMITED AND TO
SEAMLESSLY SWITCH BETWEEN WiFi AND CELLAR. AND, OF COURSE, THIS ALL HAPPENS AUTOMATICALLY BEHIND THE SCENES SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT IT.
ALL THIS TECHNOLOGY COMBINES WITH A SMOOTH INTERFACE THAT FADES AWAY AN I LOUING YOU TO FOCUS ON EACH OTHER IN
BEAUTIFUL HD VIDEO AND AUDIO. THIS IS WHAT MAKES DUO A VIDEO CALLING EXPERIENCE THAT FEELS UNLIKE ANYTHING YOU'VE
USED BEFORE. NOW, I'D LIKE TO SHOW YOU A SHORT VIDEO THAT SHOWS HOW DUO BRINGS MAGIC BACK TO VIDEO CALLING.
[ VIDEO PLAYING. ] >>> YOU READY? ONE, TWO,
THREE! >>> HAPPY BIRTHDAY! >>> READY? THREE!
>>> READY? THREE! >>> MEET BABY ALEX. >>> READY? ONE, TWO, THREE! >>> NO WAY!
>>> THAT'S TOO CUTE. >>> WHERE ARE YOU?
>>> HOLD ON, I GOT TO GET THIS. [ LAUGHTER ] >>> THREE.
(SCREAMING). [ VIDEO CONCLUDES ] [ APPLAUSE ]
>>Erik Kay: YOU CAN REALLY SEE HOW FUN AND SPONTANEOUS VIDEO CALLS BECOME WITH DUO. WE'RE INCREDIBLY EXCITED TO
BE CONNECTING PEOPLE ALL OVER THE WORLD WITH THESE TWO NEW APPS: ALLO, A SMART MESSAGING APP WITH EXPRESSION
AND THE POWER OF THE GOOGLE ASSISTANT. AND DUO, A SIMPLE VIDEO APP WITH THE SPONTANEITY OF KNOCK KNOCK.
BOTH ALLO AND DUO WILL BE AVAILABLE THIS SUMMER ON ANDROID AND iOS. [ APPLAUSE ]
NOW TO TALK TO YOU A BIT ABOUT ANDROID, I WOULD LIKE TO INVITE TO THE STAGE OUR RESIDENT ROCK STAR DAVE BURKE
BURKE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >>Dave Burke: THANKS, ERIC.
HEY, I'M DAVE. IT'S AMAZING TO BE HERE AT GOOGLE I/O 2016
AT THE SHORELINE AMPHITHEATRE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ALL RIGHT. WHAT A GREAT
VENUE. I THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE THE VERY CLOSEST I GET TO MY CHILDHOOD DREAM OF BEING A ROCK STAR ON THE
STAGE. [ LAUGHTER ] THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT NERDS BEING ALLOWED ON A ROCK STAR STAGE LIKE THIS. ANYWAY, SO FAR WE'VE TALKED
ABOUT THE SCALE OF MOBILE AND WE'RE THINKING ABOUT EVOLVING OUR PRODUCTS TO BE SMARTER AND MORE ASSISTIVE THROUGH
MACHINE LEARNING AND AI AND A KEY DRIVER OF THIS SCALE IS ANDROID. AS YOU'VE HEARD, THIS YEAR MARKS THE TENTH
ANNIVERSARY OF OUR FIRST DEVELOPER CONFERENCE. IT'S ALSO BEEN 10 YEARS SINCE WE STARTED WORKING ON ANDROID.
SO HOW ARE WE DOING? WELL, ANDROID IS THE MOST POPULAR OS IN THE WORLD. MORE THAN 600 ANDROID
SMARTPHONES HAVE LAUNCHED IN THE LAST YEAR ALONE. EVERYTHING FROM DISNEY PRINCESS PHONES TO METAL
UNIBODY DEVICES TRICKED OUT IN TITANIUM. THERE'S A PHONE FOR EVERYONE. AND AS ANDROID CONTINUES TO
EXPAND INTO NEW SCREENS LIKE ON THE WRIST AND IN THE CAR AND ON TVs AND CONNECTED DEVICES, THERE'S INCREASED
OPPORTUNITY FOR DEVELOPERS TO REACH USERS WHETHER THEY'RE AT HOME OR ON THE GO. ANDROID WEAR. THERE ARE NOW
12 PARTNER BRANDS WITH ICONIC WATCH MAKERS LIKE TAG HEUER AND DESIGNERS LIKE MICHAEL KORS.
ANDROID TV. THERE ARE NOW MILLIONS OF NEW ANDROID TV DEVICES, GROWING RAPIDLY, WITH MEDIA CONTENT AND GAMES
FROM THE BIGGEST NAMES IN THE INDUSTRY. ANDROID AUTO. MORE THAN 100 CAR MODELS AND STEREOS
HAVE LAUNCHED WITH ANOTHER HUNDRED ON THEIR WAY BY THE END OF THE YEAR. AND, OF COURSE, GOOGLE PLAY.
THERE WERE 65 BILLION INSTALLS IN THE LAST YEAR ALONE AND I'M JUST IN CONSTANT AWE OF ALL THE
AMAZING APPS AND SERVICES THAT YOU'RE CREATING THAT'S FUELING THIS. [ APPLAUSE ]
SO LET'S TALK ABOUT WHAT'S NEW IN THE PLATFORM. WITH
THE N RELEASE, WE WANTED TO ACHIEVE A NEW LEVEL OF PRODUCT EXCELLENCE SO WE SET ABOUT REDESIGNING AND
REWRITING MANY FUNDAMENTAL ASPECTS OF HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS. NOW, A LOT OF THE FEATURES IN
N WERE INSPIRED BY USERS. HOW THEY USE THEIR PHONES, WHAT THEY'VE TOLD US, AND HOW WE THINK WE CAN MAKE THEIR
DAY-TO-DAY EXPERIENCE BETTER AND MORE USEFUL. THIS YEAR WE DECIDED TO DO SOMETHING A LITTLE DIFFERENT
BY RELEASING EARLY DEVELOPER PREVIEWS OF THE N RELEASE BEFORE GOOGLE I/O. WE WANT TO SHARE OUR WORK IN
PROGRESS WITH YOU AS WE BUILD IT SO WE HAVE MORE TIME FOR YOUR FEEDBACK. ALSO, GETTING THE PLATFORM
OUT EARLIER MEANS THERE'S MORE TIME FOR APP DEVELOPERS AND DEVICE MAKERS TO BE READY FOR THE RELEASE LATER THIS
YEAR. THE RESPONSE TO THE N DEVELOPER PREVIEW HAS BEEN OVERWHELMING. MANY OF YOU
ARE ALREADY DEVELOPING ON THE N PREVIEW RELEASE ON A DAILY BASIS AND IT'S JUST HUMBLING TO BE PART OF A PROJECT OF
THIS SCALE. SO THANK YOU FOR ALL OF THE FEEDBACK SO FAR.
NOW, OFTEN ONE OF THE HARDEST PARTS OF CREATING AN ANDROID RELEASE IS COMING UP WITH THE NAME. AND I HAVE NO IDEA
WHY, BUT THIS YEAR THE N DESSERT NAME IS PROVING TRICKIER THAN ALL OF THE OTHERS, SO FOR THE FIRST TIME
EVER, WE'RE GOING TO BE INVITING THE WORLD TO SUBMIT THEIR IDEAS TO WWW.ANDROID.COM/N.
[ LAUGHTER ] AND WE'RE FORWARD TO YOUR INPUT BUT PLEASE DON'T CALL IT NAMEYMcNAMEFACE. I
SHOULD ADD THAT WE ALL RESERVE THE RIGHT TO PICK THE WINNER. [ LAUGHTER ] ALL RIGHT. IN THE MEANTIME, LET'S JUMP STRAIGHT IN AND
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE BIGGEST CHANGES IN N AROUND PERFORMANCE, SECURITY, AND PRODUCTIVITY.
LET'S START WITH PERFORMANCE. WE'VE IMPROVED PERFORMANCE IN N IN TWO KEY AREAS: GRAPHICS AND RUNTIME.
IN RECENT ANDROID RELEASES, WE EXTENDED THE OpenGL STANDARD TO BRING ADVANCED GRAPHICS CAPABILITIES,
USUALLY FOUND ON DESKTOP AND GAME CONSOLES, TO MOBILE. WITH N, WE'RE MAKING OUR BIGGEST LEAP FORWARD WITH THE
INTRODUCTION OF VULKAN. VULKAN IS A MODERN 3D GRAPHICS API DESIGNED TO GIVE GAME DEVELOPERS DIRECT
CONTROL OF THE GPU TO PRODUCE INCREDIBLE GRAPHICS AND COMPUTE PERFORMANCE. AND WE MADE A CONCERTED
EFFORT TO WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY ON VULKAN SO YOU CAN USE THE SAME PAYS AND GRAPHICS ASSETS AND SHADERS
ON THE DESKTOP AS WELL AS MOBILE. BECAUSE VULKAN HAS A LOWER CPU OVERHEAD THAN OpenGL,
GAME DEVELOPERS ARE ABLE TO SQUEEZE IN MORE EFFECTS PER FRAME WHILE STILL MAINTAINING A HIGH FRAME RATE. LET'S
TAKE A LOOK AT A NEXUS 6P RUNNING A KNEW VERSION OF THE NEED FOR SPEED GAME BY ELECTRONIC ARTS AND THERE ARE
A BUNCH OF REALLY NICE IMPROVEMENTS IN THIS VERSION THANKS TO VULKAN. YOU'LL NOTICE THE BEAUTIFUL GRAPHICS
IN REFLEXION ON THE CAR. ALSO CHECK OUT THE REALISTIC MOTION BLUR EFFECT WHICH IS COMPUTED FOR EVERY OBJECT AT
THE SIDE OF THE ROAD. AND THERE'S A REALLY NICE WATER SURFACE EFFECT ON THE ROAD. AND THE SHADERS FOR
THESE ARE PRE-COMPILED AHEAD OF TIME AND CAN NOW RUN ANYWHERE. SO THAT'S GRAPHICS
PERFORMANCE. WE'VE ALSO SPENT A LOT OF EFFORT WORKING ON IMPROVING THE ANDROID RUNTIME.
FIRST, WE'VE MADE MAJOR OPTIMIZATIONS TO OUR COMPILER. THE COMPILER IN N PERFORMS ANYTHING FROM 30 TO
600% FASTER ON MAJOR CPU BENCHMARKS LIKE DHRYSTONE. SECOND, WE'VE ADDED A NEW JUST-IN-TIME OR LEGITIMATE
COMPILE HE COMPILER AND LEGITIMATE COMPILATION MEANS THAT APP INSTALLS ARE FASTER. 75% FASTER IN N. SO NOW
USERS CAN GET UP AND RUNNING MUCH MORE QUICKLY ON YOUR APPS. AND ALSO BECAUSE LEGITIMATE IS MORE SELECTIVE
ABOUT WHICH METHODS IT COMPILES, BY A FULL 50%.
NOW, UNLIKE CONVENTIONAL LEGITIMATE SYSTEMS, THE ANDROID RUNTIME USES PROFILE GUIDE THE OPTIMIZATION TO
WRITE COMPILED CODE TO FLASH FOR THE NEXT TIME YOU RUN THE APP, SO THIS IMPROVES PERFORMANCE AND REDUCES
BATTERY CONSUMPTION. IN SUMMARY, THE NEW LEGITIMATE COMPILER IMPROVES SOFTWARE PERFORMANCE, MAKES
INSTALLS FASTER, AND REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF STORAGE YOU NEED FOR APPS ON YOUR DEVICE. LET'S TALK ABOUT ANOTHER BIG
AREA OF FOCUS FOR US. SECURITY. WE DESIGNED ANDROID FROM THE BEGINNING WITH A MULTILAYERED
DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH SECURITY ARCHITECTURE. AND ANDROID EMPLOYS THE LATEST CUTTING-EDGE SECURITY
TECHNOLOGIES. THINGS LIKE SELINUX, VERIFIED BOOT INTEGRITY, AND FULL DISK ENCRYPTION.
WITH N, WE'RE CONTINUING TO STRENGTHEN OUR DEFENSES IN THREE KEY WAYS. FIRST, N INTRODUCES
FILE-BASED ENCRYPTION. BY ENCRYPTING AT THE FILE LEVEL INSTEAD OF THE BLOCK LEVEL, WE'RE ABLE TO BETTER ISOLATE
AND PROTECT INDIVIDUAL USERS OF THE SYSTEM. SECOND, WE LEARNED THE IMPORTANCE LAST YEAR OF
HARDENING THE SECURITY OF THE MEDIA FRAMEWORK. ESPECIALLY SINCE IT'S ACCESSING FILES FROM ANYWHERE ON THE
INTERNET. SO IN N, WE'VE SPLIT OUT KEY SUBSYSTEMS INTO INDIVIDUAL SELINUX PROTECTED PROCESSES.
THINGS LIKE CODECS AND FILE EXTRACTORS. BY IMPROVING THE SECURITY OF THE MEDIA FRAMEWORK, WE IMPROVE THE
SECURITY OF THE ENTIRE DEVICE. THIRD, AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY COOL, N
AUTOMATICALLY KEEPS YOUR PHONE UP-TO-DATE WITH THE LATEST VERSION OF THE SYSTEM SOFTWARE WITHOUT YOU HAVING
TO DO ANYTHING. LIKE CHROMEBOOKS, NEW ANDROID DEVICES BUILT ON N HAVE TWO SYSTEM UPDATE -- TWO SYSTEM
IMAGES. SO WHEN AN UPDATE IS AVAILABLE, YOUR PHONE WILL AUTOMATICALLY DOWNLOAD THE NEW SYSTEM IMAGE IN THE
BACKGROUND. SO THE NEXT TIME YOU POWER UP YOUR PHONE, IT WILL SEAMLESSLY SWITCH INTO THE
NEW SOFTWARE IMAGE. YOU'RE NO LONGER ASKED FOR YOUR PASSWORD WHEN THE PHONE POWERS UP, THANKS TO
FILE-BASED ENCRYPTION AND A NEW FEATURE CALLED "DIRECT BOOT." AND THAT PESKY "ANDROID IS UPGRADING
DIALOGUE" IS FINALLY GONE, THANKS TO THE NEW LEGITIMATE
JIT COMPILER. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] IS ACTUALLY DELETING CODE, BY THE WAY. ALL RIGHT. THIS APPROACH TO SOFTWARE UPDATES
IS ONE OF THE MOST LOVED FEATURES OF CHROMEBOOKS AND I'M REALLY EXCITED TO BRING IT TO MOBILE AS WELL. SO THAT'S SOME OF THE WAYS WE'RE IMPROVING SECURITY MECHANISMS
IN THE PLATFORM BUT LET'S NOT FORGET ABOUT ALL OF THE SECURITY SERVICES THAT GOOGLE PROVIDES TO KEEP ALL ANDROID
DEVICES SAFE. IN FACT, WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE SCALE OF ANDROID AND GOOGLE PLAY AND THE NUMBER OF
DEVICES AND APPS OUT THERE, WE'RE PROVIDING ONE OF THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE MOBILE SECURITY SOLUTIONS IN THE
WORLD. LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT A FEW EXAMPLES. GOOGLE CHROME PROTECTS USERS
WHEN THEY'RE SURFING THE WEB THROUGH A SYSTEM CALLED SAFE BROWSING. SAFE BROWSING WARNS USERS AHEAD OF TIME
WHEN THEY'RE ABOUT TO GO TO A SITE THAT WE KNOW CONTAINS NO -- MALWARE OR IS KNOWN TO BE DECEPTIVE.
TODAY, WE'RE PROTECTING OVER 1 BILLION MOBILE CHROME USERS. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW WE
PROTECT USERS IS THROUGH THE GOOGLE PLAY STORE. ALL ANDROID APPS UNDERGO RIGOROUS SECURITY TESTING BEFORE
APPEARING ON THE STORE. WE REVIEW EVERY APP TO MAKE SURE IT MEETS OUR POLICIES. WE ALSO RUN AN APP SECURITY
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM WITH DEVELOPERS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES. FOR
EXAMPLE, WE'VE WORKED WITH KEY BANKING AND eCOMMERCE APPLICATIONS TO SURE THEY'RE USING HTTPS PROPERLY TO
PROTECT AGAINST MAN-IN-THE-MIDDLE ATTACKS. GOOGLE PLAY ITSELF IS BUILT ON A STATE-OF-THE-ART
CLOUD-BASED INFRASTRUCTURE WE CALL "SAFETYNET." SAFETYNET -- WITH SAFETYNET GOOGLE'S EXPERT SYSTEMS AND
MACHINE LEARNING MODELS ANALYZE BILLIONS OF SIGNALS EVERY DAY TO PREDICT BAD BEHAVIOR. IF AN APP STEPS
OUT OF LINE, GOOGLE PLAY WILL BLOCK OR UNINSTALL THE APP, NO MATTER WHERE IT WAS INSTALLED FROM.
AND THE SCALE OF SAFETYNET IS EXTRAORDINARY. EVERY DAY, WE
-- WE TEST OVER A BILLION DEVICES AND OVER 8 BILLION INSTALLED APPS. AND ALL OF THIS HAPPENS UNDER THE HOOD
TO KEEP YOU SAFE AND SECURE, NO MATTER WHAT VERSION OF ANDROID YOU'RE ON. LET'S MOVE ON.
A THIRD AREA OF FOCUS FOR US IS OUR CONTINUED EFFORT TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY. AND WE'VE TAKEN A CLOSE LOOK AT
HOW PEOPLE MULTITASK ON ANDROID, TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S WORKING FOR THEM AND WHERE WE CAN IMPROVE.
AND WE'VE PARTICULARLY FOCUSED ON THE RECENT APPS SCREEN. AND WHAT WE LEARNED FROM OUR USER RESEARCH IS
THAT OVER 99% OF THE TIME, PEOPLE ONLY SELECT AN APP WITHIN THE LAST SEVEN. SO WE DECIDED TO SIMPLIFY BY
AUTOMATICALLY REMOVING APPS IN THE LIST THAT YOU HAVEN'T USED IN A WHILE. THIS THEN MAKES IT MUCH
EASIER TO FIND THE APP THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. ALSO, BASED ON POPULAR DEMAND, WE'VE FINALLY ADDED A
"CLEAR ALL" BUTTON AT THE TOP. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YEAH. FEELS GOOD!
BUT MY ABSOLUTE FAVORITE FEATURE IS SOMETHING THAT WE CALL "QUICK SWITCH." YOU CAN NOW FLIP TO THE PREVIOUS APP
YOU WERE IN JUST BY DOUBLE-TAPPING THE RECENTS BUTTON FROM ANYWHERE. YOU CAN THINK OF IT LIKE A
SIMPLIFIED ALT-TAB. AND IT'S AMAZINGLY USEFUL IN SO MANY SITUATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, LET'S SAY I'M IN A PHONE CALL
AND I'M TRYING TO COORDINATE AN EVENT. I CAN FLIP OVER TO THE CALENDAR APP I WAS JUST IN BY DOUBLE-TAPPING THE
RECENTS BUTTON AT THE BOTTOM RIGHT. FROM THERE, I CAN CHECK MY SCHEDULE AND THEN FLIP BACK TO THE DIALER BY
DOUBLE-TAPPING THE RECENTS BUTTON AGAIN. IT'S PRETTY COOL. NOW, MANY OF YOU HAVE ALSO ASKED FOR THE ABILITY TO DISPLAY MORE THAN ONE APP AT
THE SAME TIME. SO WE'VE INVESTED A LOT OF EFFORT IN REDESIGNING OUR WINDOW MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK IN N.
AND WE'RE INTRODUCING TWO POWERFUL NEW WINDOWING MODES IN THIS RELEASE: SPLIT-SCREEN AND
PICTURE-IN-PICTURE. SPLINT-SCREEN IS DESIGNED FOR TABLETS AND PHONES AND IT'S REALLY SIMPLE TO USE.
SO FOLKS LET'S SAY I'M WATCHING A VIDEO ON YouTUBE TO LEARN HOW TO MAKE THE BEST NACHOS. I CAN LONG-TAP ON
THE RECENTS BUTTON TO ENTER MULTI-WINDOW AND FROM LAUNCH SOMETHING LIKE GOOGLE KEEP, FOR EXAMPLE. NOW YOU CAN
UPDATE MY SHOPPING LIST FOR INGREDIENTS WHILE I'M WATCHING THE VIDEO. THE SECOND MODE, PICTURE-IN-PICTURE, IS DESIGNED FOR ANDROID TV AND
IT'S A GREAT WAY TO LET YOU KEEP WATCHING SOMETHING WHILE YOU PERFORM ANOTHER TASK. FOR EXAMPLE, LET'S SAY I'M
WATCHING A LIVE TV PROGRAM ON RETRO GAMING AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT PACMAN AND I WANT TO SEE IF I CAN INSTALL
AND PLAY THE GAME MYSELF. I CAN PUT THE LIVE CONTENT INTO PICTURE-IN-PICTURE MODE TO KEEP WATCHING IT AND THEN
GO AHEAD AND PERFORM A VOICE SEARCH FOR PACMAN. THIS WILL THEN GIVE ME AN OPTION TO INSTALL THE GAME FROM THE
PLAY STORE, ALL AT THE SAME TIME AS WATCHING THE CONTENT. IT'S PRETTY COOL. NOTIFICATIONS IS ANOTHER AREA
WE'VE WORKED ON TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY IN ANDROID AND IT TURNS OUT THAT TODAY OVER HALF OF THE NOTIFICATIONS
SHOWN IN ANDROID ORIGINATE FROM MESSAGING APPLICATIONS. SO WE DECIDED TO MAKE SOME CHANGES TO REALLY OPTIMIZE
FOR THIS USE CASE. WE'VE ADDED A NEW DIRECT REPLY FEATURE WHICH LETS YOU QUICKLY REPLY TO A MESSAGE
LIKE SO. YOU NO LONGER NEED TO LAUNCH THE APP TO FIRE OFF A QUICK RESPONSE, SO IT'S A REAL TIME
SAVER. WE'VE ALSO ADDED A FEATURE TO GIVE YOU MORE CONTROL OVER NOTIFICATIONS. WITH N, YOU CAN LONG-TAP A
NOTIFICATION TO CHANGE ITS VISIBILITY. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN BLOCK NOTIFICATIONS FROM A GIVEN APP OR SET THEM TO
SHOW ONLY SILENTLY. SO NOW YOU'RE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHICH APPLICATION -- WHICH NOTIFICATIONS ARE IMPORTANT FOR YOU. ONE OTHER AREA WE'VE WORKED
ON TO IMPROVE YOUR PRODUCTIVITY IN ANDROID IS YOUR ABILITY TO EXPRESS YOURSELF WITH EMOJI AND
ANDROID IS THE FIRST MOBILE PLATFORM TO SUPPORT THE NEW
UNICODE 9 EMOJI STANDARD. AND WITH THIS ADDITION ARE MORE HUMAN-LOOKING GLYPHS AND SUPPORT FOR SKIN TONE
VARIATIONS. UNITED KINGDOM 9 ALSO BRINGS 72 NEW EMOJI GLYPHS, SO NOW YOU CAN LET YOUR FRIENDS NO, FOR EXAMPLE,
WHEN YOU'RE DANCING BY THE LEFT SHARK AND EATING AVOCADO
TOAST, BASICALLY MY TYPICAL FRIDAY NIGHT. [ LAUGHTER ] NOT! BUT MORE SERIOUSLY, WE'RE REALLY COMMITTED TO THIS
SPACE AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE UNICODE CONSORTIUM ON THE NEXT GENERATION OF EMOJI. IN
PARTICULAR, YOU MAY HAVE SEEN SOME OF OUR SUGGESTIONS AROUND BETTER REPRESENTING WOMEN IN PROFESSIONAL ROLES,
SO THANK YOU FOR ALL THE SUPPORT FOR THAT SO FAR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] ALL RIGHT. LET'S WRAP UP.
ANDROID N IS THE BEST VERSION OF ANDROID YET. I HAVE TO SAY THAT. BUT IT'S ACTUALLY TRUE. WE'VE MADE IT FASTER
AND MORE PERFORMANT WITH THE POWERFUL NEW JIT COMPILER AND VULKAN 3D GRAPHICS. WE'RE CONTINUING TO HARDEN OUR
SECURITY AND PROVIDE THE FIRST TRULY SEAMLESS SOFTWARE UPDATE SYSTEM FOR MOBILE. AND WE'RE MAKING USERS MORE
PRODUCTIVE. WITH BETTER MULTITASKING, BRAND-NEW MULTI-WINDOW SUPPORT AND IMPROVED
NOTIFICATIONS. IN FACT, THERE ARE OVER 250 MAJOR NEW FEATURES IN N. EVERYTHING FROM JAVA 8
LANGUAGE SUPPORT TO DATA SAVER, SETTING SUGGESTIONS AND MUCH, MUCH MORE. YOU CAN CHECK OUT THE "WHAT'S
NEW IN ANDROID" SESSION LATER TODAY TO LEARN EVEN MORE. WE'RE STILL PUTTING THE FINAL TOUCHES ON THE N RELEASE AND
WE EXPECT TO LAUNCH IT LATER THIS SUMMER, BUT IF YOU CAN'T WAIT UNTIL THEN, I'M HAPPY TODAY TO ANNOUNCE THAT WE'RE
PUBLISHING OUR FIRST BETA-QUALITY RELEASE CANDIDATE FOR YOU TO TRY OUT ON YOUR MAIN PHONE OR TABLET.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] YOU'LL BE ABLE TO OPT INTO
THE NEW BETA PROGRAM AT WWW.ANDROID.COM/BETA AND RUN N ON YOUR NEXUS 6, 9, 5X, 6P, NEXUS PLAYER, AND PIXEL C.
NOW, THERE'S ONE MORE AREA IN N THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING HARD ON THAT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT YET.
AND TO TELL YOU MORE ABOUT WHAT IT IS AND HOW IT FITS INTO OUR BIGGER PLANS, LET ME INVITE UP CLAY BAVOR. THANK
YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>>Clay Bavor:
THANK YOU, DAVE. I'M CLAY BAVOR, AND I LEAD THE VIRTUAL REALITY TEAM AT GOOGLE.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND, YEAH, JUST TO GET RIGHT TO IT, VIRTUAL REALITY IS COMING TO ANDROID N.
[ CHEERS ] SO IT ALL ACTUALLY STARTED AT A GOOGLE I/O TWO YEARS AGO WITH CARDBOARD. AND SINCE
PRETTY AMAZING THINGS. THERE ARE MILLIONS OF THEM OUT THERE IN THE WORLD, IN ALL SHAPES AND SIZES.
WE'VE ENABLED THOUSANDS OF DEVELOPERS TO BUILD THEIR FIRST VR APP, AND USERS HAVE INSTALLED OVER 50 MILLION
CARDBOARD-ENABLED APPS. WE THINK THAT'S PRETTY GOOD FOR WHAT IS, AFTER ALL, JUST A PIECE OF CARDBOARD.
NOW, WE LOVE CARDBOARD, AND FOR US, IT REPRESENTS SO MUCH OF WHAT WE THINK VR SHOULD BE ABOUT. IT SHOULD BE MOBILE.
IT SHOULD BE APPROACHABLE, IT SHOULD BE FOR EVERYONE. BUT WE KNEW IT WAS JUST A START BECAUSE THERE'S A LIMIT
TO HOW MUCH YOU CAN DO, HOW IMMERSIVE AN EXPERIENCE YOU CAN CREATE WITH CARDBOARD AND
WITH PHONES THAT WERE REALLY ONLY MEANT TO BE PHONES. WE WANTED TO CREATE SOMETHING WHICH HAS THE BEST ATTRIBUTES
OF CARDBOARD BUT WHICH IS ALSO COMFORTABLE, RICHLY INTERACTIVE AND FAR MORE IMMERSIVE.
BUT TO CREATE THAT KIND OF IMMERSION, YOU HAVE TO SOLVE -- TO MAKE YOUR BRAIN SAY, YEP, I'M SOMEWHERE ELSE, YOU
HAVE TO SOLVE A LOT OF REALLY HARD PROBLEMS ACROSS ALL PARTS OF THE VR EXPERIENCE. YOU HAVE TO DESIGN A SYSTEM
THAT'S CAPABLE OF RENDERING AT VERY HIGH FRAME RATES AND RESOLUTION. TO MAKE THE EXPERIENCE REALLY KIVEL YOU
HAVE TO MINIMIZE WHAT'S CALLED MOTION TO PHOTON LATENCY. THAT'S THE DELAY BETWEEN WHEN THE MOVE YOUR HEAD AND WHEN THE PICTURE UPDATES TO REFLECT THAT
MOTION. AND YOU YOU NEED TO SOLVE FOR HOW YOU INTERACT WITH THINGS IN VR. AND WHEN YOU NAIL THOSE THINGS IT
JUST FEELS LIKE YOU'RE THERE. WELL, WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THESE PROBLEMS AND MORE. AND WHAT WE'VE BUILT WON'T BE
AVAILABLE UNTIL THIS FALL, BUT WE'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE YOU TO IT TODAY. WE CALL IT DAYDREAM.
DAYDREAM IS OUR PLATFORM FOR HI HIGH QUALITY MOBILE VIRTUAL REALITY, AND IN IT ARE ALL
THE INGREDIENTS YOU NEED TO HAVE IMMERSIVE VR EXPERIENCE. OVER TIME DAYDREAM WILL ENCOMPASS VR IN MANY
DIFFERENT SAIPS AND SIZES BUT TOOS IT'S HOW IT WILL ENABLE VR ON SMARTPHONES. AND THERE ARE TWO PARTS OF
IT. THE SMARTPHONES THEMSELVES INCLUDING VR OPTIMIZATION TO ANDROID N. A REFERENCE DESIGN FOR HEADSET
AND CONTROLLER. AND APPS, BOTH HOW YOU GET THEM THROUGH GOOGLE PLAY AND THE APPS THEMSELVES. WE'VE DESIGNED
AND BUILT EACH PART IN CONCERT WITH THE OTHERS WITH A FOCUS ON GETTING THE END-TO-END USER EXPERIENCE
JUST RIGHT. SO LET'S START WITH SMOAPS. THE FIRST THING WE DID WAS LOOK AT WHAT IT TAKES TO
BUILD A SMARTPHONE THAT'S GREAT AT BEING A SMARTPHONE BUT ALSO AT BEING THE CORE OF A VR SYSTEM. AND WITH INPUT
FROM THE MAJOR SILICON VENDORS AND SMARTPHONE MANUFACTURERS, WE'VE CREATED A SET OF PHONE SPECIFICATIONS
FOR VR. AND WE CALL PHONES THAT MEET THESE SPECS DAYDREAM-READY. AND THE SPECS INCLUDE THINGS
LIKE HIGH PERFORMANCE SENSORS FOR ACCURATE HEAD TRACKING, DISPLAYS WITH A FAST RESPONSE TIME TO MINIMIZE BLUR, AND
POWERFUL MOBILE PROCESSORS. AND IF A PHONE MEETS THESE SPECS, IT WILL BE CAPABLE OF DELIVERING A GREAT VR
EXPERIENCE. BUT THE SMARTPHONE ITSELF, IT'S ONLY PART OF THE STORY. THE OPERATING SYSTEM, THE
SOFTWARE, IT NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO MAKE USE OF ALL OF THESE CAPABILITIES, ALL WHILE KEEPING LATENCY TO AN
ABSOLUTE MINIMUM. SO WE'VE INTRODUCED WHAT WE CALL VR MODE AS PART OF ANDROID
ANDROID N. AND WE'VE WORKED AT ALL LEVELS OF THE ANDROID STACK TO OPTIMIZE IT FOR VR. AND WE FOCUSED IN PARTICULAR
ON PERFORMANCE AND LATENCY, WHICH REBROUGHT DOWN TO UNDER 20 MILLISECONDS. BY ADDING THINGS LIKE
SINGLE BUFFER RENDERING, AND VR SYSTEM UI, SO NOTIFICATIONS AND ALERTS COME THROUGH PROPERLY IN VR. AND
ALL OF THIS MAKES FOR A REALLY COMFORTABLE VR EXPERIENCE THAT WE THINK USERS ARE GOING TO LOVE.
NOW, IT'S IMPORTANT, THESE IMPROVEMENTS ARE PART OF THE CORE OF ANDROID N, SO THE ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM CAN BENEFIT.
AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR DEVELOPERS IS THERE ARE GOING TO BE A LOT OF DAYDREAM-READY PHONES. IN FACT, SAMSUNG,
ALCATEL, ASUS, HTC, HUE WEI, LG, XIAOMI, ALL WILL HAVE
PHONES COMPATIBLE WITH THE DAYDREAM-READY SPEC AND SEVERAL WILL BE READY THIS FALL. CHEEP CHEERP.
SO THAT'S PHONES WITH DAYDREAM-READY PHONE SPECS AND THE VR OPTIMIZEIZATIONS AS PART OF DROIRN.
LET'S TURN TO HEADSETS. THIS IS OBVIOUS BUT A HEADSET IS
SOMETHING YOU WEAR ON YOUR HEAD. AND BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU WEAR, THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS YOU NEED TO GET JUST RIGHT. IT HAS TO HAVE GREAT OPTICS. IT
HAS TO BE COMFORTABLE. THE MATERIALS NEED TO FEEL GOOD. AND IT NEEDS TO BE REALLY EASY TO PUT ON AND TAKE OFF. WE'VE TAKEN WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IN ALL OF THESE AREAS
AND WE'VE CREATED A REFERENCE DESIGN FOR HEADSETS THAT WILL WORK ALAN EUSTACELY WITH DAYDREAM-READY ALAN SEAMLESSLY
WITH DAYDREAM-READY PHONES. AND WE'RE SHARING THE DESIGN WITH PARTNERS ACROSS THE ECOSYSTEM AND THERE ARE BE SEVERAL AVAILABLE THIS FALL. NOW,
WHEN IT COMES TO VR, EVERYONE THINKS ABOUT HEADSETS, BUT THE CONTROLLER, HOW YOU INTERACT WITH VR, IT'S JUST
AS IMPORTANT. AND WE WANTED TO CREATE A CONTROLLER THAT'S OPTIMIZED FOR VR, THAT'S BOTH POWERFUL AND INTUITIVE. AND
SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON A CONTROLLER FOR DAYDREAM. IT LOOKS LIKE THIS. AND IF WE ACTUALLY ZOOM IN A
LITTLE BIT, YOU CAN SEE THE CONTROLLER ITSELF, IT'S VERY SIMPLE. THERE ARE FEW BUTTONS AND A CLICKABLE
TOUCHPAD SO YOU CAN SCROLL AND SWIPE. BUT HIDDEN INSIDE THE CONTROLLER IS THE MAGIC. WE'VE BUILT IN ORIENTATION
SENSORS SO IT KNOWS WHERE IT'S POINTING, HOW IT'S TURNING. AND YOU CAN DO SOME PRETTY AWESOME THINGS WITH
IT. LET'S HAVE A LOOK.
[ VIDEO PLAYING

>>Clay Bavor: [ APPLAUSE ] >>Clay Bavor:
SO AS YOU CAN SEE, THE CONTROLLER, IT'S SUPER FLEXIBLE, AND THE DEVELOPERS WE'VE SHARED IT
WITH ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT. NOW THE CONTROLLER, TOO, WILL BE PART OF THE REFERENCE DESIGN THAT WE'RE SHARING WITH PARTNERS, WITH THE FIRST AVAILABLE THIS FALL.
OKAY. SO WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SMARTPHONES AND OPERATING SYSTEMS, HEADSETS AND CONTROLLERS. BUT ULTIMATELY,
THAT'S NOT WHAT VR IS ABOUT. IT'S ABOUT WHAT YOU CAN EXPERIENCE. SO LET'S TURN TO APPS, WHAT
YOU CAN DO IN VR. NOW, FIRST, IF YOU'RE A DEVELOPER, YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT UPSTREAM, FROM
SOMEONE USING YOUR APP OR PLAYING YOUR GAME. USERS HAVE TO FIND IT IN A STORE, BUY IT, INSTALL IT, LAUNCH
IT. WELL, THIS WILL ALL WORK SEAMLESSLY IN DAYDREAM. AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE'VE BUILT GOOGLE PLAY FOR VR.
USERS WILL BE ABLE TO BROWSE AND SEARCH AND BUY AND INSTALL VR APPS IN VR. AND ONCE YOU'VE INSTALLED AN APP,
YOU CAN KEEP COMING BACK TO IT FROM WHAT WE CALL DAYDREAM HOME, WHICH GIVES YOU ACCESS TO ALL OF YOUR FAVORITE GAMES
AND APPS. LET'S ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT SOME OF THOSE APPS, THE THINGS YOU CAN DO AND THE
PLACES YOU CAN GO. OUR PARTNERS LIKE THE NEW YORK TIMES AND THE WALL STREET JOURNAL AND CNN ARE
BRINGING THEIR VR APPS TO DAYDREAM SO YOU'LL BE ABLE TO EXPERIENCE THE WORLD'S NEWS LIKE YOU'RE ACTUALLY THERE.
HULU, NETFLIX, HBO, EVEN IMAX ARE BRINGING THEIR LIBRARIES TO DAYDREAM, SO YOU'LL BE ABLE TO WATCH SHOWS AND
MOVIES IN A VIRTUAL CINEMA OR AN IMMERSIVE 3D FILM IN A
VIRTUAL IMAX THEATER. THIS IS ONE OF THE DOZEN IMAX FILMS THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU BUT
I'M PRETTY FIRED UP ABOUT HANGING OUT WITH ASTRONAUTS IN VR. SOMETHING ELSE THAT'S GOING
TO BE PRETTY AWESOME IN DAYDREAM IS GAMES. WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE LIKES OF EUBIE SOFT, CCP, NETEASE
AND ELECTRONIC ARTS, AND THESE AMAZING DEVELOPERS ARE CREATING GAMES THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE A OF ALL THAT WE'VE
TALKED ABOUT AND THERE ARE SOME AMAZING THINGS IN THE WORKS. WE'VE ALSO BEEN WORKING ON ON SOME OF OUR OWN
APPS. GOOGLE PLAY MOVIES IS COMING TO DAYDREAM COMPLETE WITH HIGH DEFINITION DRM VIDEO SUPPORT. THAT MEANS
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO WATCH MOVIES AND TV SHOWS FROM PLAY BUT IN A VIRTUAL MOVIE THEATER.
STREETVIEW IS COMING TO DAYDREAM, SO YOU'LL BE ABLE TO WALK THE STREETS OF THE WORLD WITHOUT HAVING TO FLY
AROUND THE WORLD. AND GOOGLE PHOTOS WILL SUPPORT VR PHOTOS SO YOU CAN STEP INSIDE AND RELIVE FAVORITE MOMENTS.
AND THERE'S ONE MORE. YOUTUBE. WE'VE REBUILT YOUTUBE FROM THE GROUND UP FOR VR. IN IT IS VOICE
SEARCH, DISCOVERY, YOUR FAVORITE PLAYLISTS; AGAIN, ALL IN VR. AND WE'VE ADDED SPATIAL AUDIO, IMPROVED VR
VIDEO STREAMING SO YOU'LL BE ABLE TO STEP INSIDE THE WORLD'S LARGEST COLLECTION OF VR VIDEOS AND EXPERIENCE
PLACES AND CONCERTS AND EVENTS LIKE YOU'RE ACTUALLY THERE. AND BY THE WAY, YOU'LL ALSO BE ABLE TO WATCH EVERY SINGLE STANDARD VIDEO CURRENTLY ON
YOUTUBE, BUT IN A VERY DIFFERENT WAY. AND WE THINK PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOVE IT. SO THAT'S DAYDREAM, OUR
PLATFORM FOR HIGH-QUALITY MOBILE VIRTUAL REALITY.
DAYDREAM-READY SMARTPHONES WITH VR OPSIZATIONS
OPTIMIZATIONS AS PART OF ANDROID N, A COMFORTABLE HEADSET AND CONTROLLER AND SOME AMAZING EXPERIENCES.
ALL DESIGNED IN CONCERT AND OPEN AND AT THE SCALE OF ANDROID. NOW, DAYDREAM ARRIVES THIS FALL BUT YOU CAN GET STARTED DEVELOPING FOR IT TODAY WITH
THE LATEST ANDROID DEVELOPER PREVIEW. AND WE'LL GO INTO THAT, AND MORE, TOMORROW HERE AT 9:00 A.M.
SO THAT'S IT FOR VR AND ANDROID. TO TELL YOU ABOUT WEARABLES AND ANDROID, I'D LIKE TO TURN IT OVER TO DAVID
SINGLETON. THANKS. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE
>>David Singleton: THANKS, ]CLAY. WE LAUNCHED DROID WEAR
AT I/O TWO YEARS AGO AND SINCE THEN, WE'VE PARTNERED WITH 12 BRANDS TO PAIR DISTINCTIVE STYLES WITH THE
LATEST IN WEARABLE TECHNOLOGY. AND THE RESULT IS AN IMPRESSIVE COLLECTION OF OVER 100 DIFFERENT
BEAUTIFUL DESIGNS. SO WHETHER YOU ADMIRE THE HERITAGE OF TAG HEUER OR THE ICONIC DESIGN OF MICHAEL KORS
KORS, SPEND YOUR TIME HIKING A TRAIL OR RIDING A WAVE, YOU CAN WEAR WHAT YOU WANT. AND ANDROID WEAR WORKS WITH
ANDROID AND iPHONES BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT PHONE YOU CARRY IN YOUR POCKET, YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE ABLE TO WEAR
WHAT YOU WANT ON YOUR WRIST. AND TODAY I'M SHOWING A PREVIEW OF OUR BIGGEST PLATFORM UPDATE YET. ANDROID
WEAR 2.0. [ APPLAUSE ]
OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, WE'VE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT WHAT PEOPLE WANT AND DON'T WANT FROM A WATCH. WE KNOW
THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT ROLE OF YOUR WATCH IS HELPING YOU STAY CONNECTED TO WHAT MATTERS, TO IMPORTANT, TIMELY
INFORMATION, TO THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE, AND TO YOUR HEALTH ALL FROM YOUR WRIST. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE EVOLVING
THE PLATFORM TO BUILD EVEN BETTER EXPERIENCES FOR THE WATCH FACE, MESSAGING, AND FITNESS. ANDROID WEAR
ALREADY HAS THOUSANDS OF WATCH FACES YOU CAN DOWNLOAD AND NOW WE'RE MAKING THEM EVEN MORE USEFUL BY LETTING
ANY WATCH FACE SHOW DATA FROM ANY APP. SO NOW YOU CAN MIX AND MATCH THE STYLES YOU LOVE WITH THE INFORMATION THAT'S
MOST USEFUL TO YOU. LET'S TAKE A LOOK. JEFF CHANG FROM THE WEAR TEAM HAS THE NEWEST LG WATCH WITH
LTE. AND HERE YOU CAN SEE A WATCH FACE FROM ZUHANDEN. JEFF HAS CUSTOMIZED IT WITH HIS CALL LEE COUNT FROM
LIFESUM, STOCK INFORMATION FROM ROBINHOOD, AND HIS TASKS FROM TODOIST. IF HE WANTS TO SEE OTHER TASKS FOR TODAY, HE
SIMPLY TAPS RIGHT THERE ON THE WATCH FACE AND SEES A REMINDER TO CALL MOM. AND WATCHES ARE UNIQUELY
SUITED TO CONNECT US TO THOSE PEOPLE WE LOVE. YOU'LL NEVER MISS A CALL FROM YOUR CHILD'S SCHOOL OR A MESSAGE FROM A
CLOSE FRIEND. AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE REDESIGNING KEY EXPERIENCING ON THE WATCH TO BE EVEN MORE INTUITIVE AND
ENABLING NEW WAYS TO RESPOND TO MESSAGES DESIGNED JUST FOR YOUR WRIST. THIS INCLUDES SMART REPLY,
THAT KNOWS THE CONTEXT OF YOUR MESSAGE, BEST-IN-CLASS HANDWRITING RECOGNITION AND A NEW KEYED
BOARD HERE'S WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WHEN JEFF GETS A MESSAGE FROM A FRIEND. HE HAPPENS TO REPLY, CHOOSES
HANDWRITING INPUT AND NOW HE USES HIS FINGER TO SKETCH BIG LETTERS ON THE WATCH AND THE TEXT RECOGNIZE AUTOMATICALLY
AND NOW SHE KNOWS WITH ONE MORE GO SHE KNOWS THAT HE'LL BE THERE
AT 3:00 P.M. >>> MANY OF YOU WANT YOUR WATCH TO MANY
OF YOU WANT BE LIKE A PERSONAL COACH, HELPING YOUR YOU STAY AWARE, MOTIVATED AND CONNECTED TO YOUR BODIESOME.
FIRST, WE'RE IMPROVING WATCH THE FITNESS EXPERIENCE WITH GOOGLEFIT PLATFORMS WITH
AUTOMATIC ACTIVITY RECOGNITION. SECOND, YOUR APPS CAN EXCHANGE DATA USING THE GOOGLEFIT API, SO INFORMATION LIKE CALORIES
CONSUMEDWATCHED IN A NUTRITION APP WITH SYNC WITH CALORIES BURNED IN A RUNNING APP AND
FINALLY, WE'RE EXPANDING THE WAYS YOU CAN ENJOY LISTENING TO MUSIC WHILE YOU WORK OUT. EVEN WHEN YOU LEAVE YOUR
PHONE BEHIND. WHEN YOU WANT TO GO FOR A RUN, JUST GO WITH THE WATCH YOU'RE ALREADY WEARING. NO
NEED TO STRAP YOUR PHONE IN AN AWKWARD ARMBAND. AND THANKS TO THE HARDWARE SENSORS ON YOUR WATCH AND
AUTOMATIC ACTIVITY RECOGNITION, APPS LIKE STRAVA WILL START TRACKING YOUR TIME AND DISTANCE WHEN YOU START
RUNNING. AND IF YOU ENJOY MUSIC WHILE WORKING OUT, YOU CAN LAUNCH SPOTIFY RIGHT FROM YOUR WATCH FACE.
[ MUSIC ]
AND THE BEST PART OF ALL OF THIS, YOU DON'T EVEN NEED A PHONE. IN FACT, WHEN JEFF WAS SHOWING YOU THE DEMOS,
HIS PHONE WAS TURNED OFF! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
AND EVERYTHING YOU SAW HERE TODAY, FROM SENDING MESSAGES
TO STREAMING MUSIC WORKED ON JUST HIS WATCH. WITH ANDROID WEAR 2.0, APPS CAN BE STAND-ALONE. THAT
MEANS THE APPS ON YOUR WATCH CAN HAVE DIRECT NETWORK ACCESS TO THE CLOUD VIA BLUETOOTH, WiFi, OR A
CELLULAR CONNECTION. AND THAT MEANS A FAST AND RICHER ON-WATCH APP EXPERIENCE FOR BOTH ANDROID AND iPHONE
USERS. WITH STAND-ALONE APPS, WATCHES WITH CELLULAR SUPPORT BECOME EVEN MORE POWERFUL.
YOU'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE CALLS, GET HELP FROM GOOGLE, AND USE YOUR FAVORITE APPS RIGHT ON THE WATCH, NO MATTER WHERE
YOUR PHONE IS OR EVEN IF IT'S ON OR OFF. STARTING TODAY
DEVELOPERS CAN DOWNLOAD A PREVIEW OF ANDROID WEAR 2.0 AND EVERYONE WILL BE ABLE TO ENJOY THESE
EXPERIENCES IN THE FALL. IT'S TIME FOR US TO REIMAGINE
WHAT'S POSSIBLE FOR WEARABLES TOGETHER. AND WE CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE INCREDIBLE THINGS THAT YOU WILL BUILD. AND NOW
HERE'S ONE EXAMPLE FROM THE WIDER ANDROID DEVELOPER COMMUNITY.
[ VIDEO PLAYING. ]
[ VIDEO CONCLUDES ] [ APPLAUSE ]
>>Jason Titus: HI. I'M JASON TITUS I LEAD OUR
DEVELOPER PRODUCT GROUP HERE AT GOOGLE. AND AS YOU CAN SEE, SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS ARE CHANGING OUR WORLD IN A BIG
WAY. IN FACT, IT'S HARD TO FIND AN ASPECT OF OUR LIVES THAT HASN'T BEEN TOUCHED FROM HOW WE LEARN TO HOW WE GET
AROUND, TO HOW WE MEET PEOPLE. YOU ARE CONSTANTLY FINDING WAYS TO USE KNEW NEW AND
EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES TO IMPROVE OUR LIVES.
DESPITE ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES,BUT IT'S REALLY HARD TO GO FROM AN IDEA TO BUILDING A
GREAT PRODUCT TO GETTING IT IN USER'S HANDS. SO I'D LIKE TO SHARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING OVER
THE LAST YEAR TO MAKE THIS PROCESS EASIER ON ANY PLATFORM. LET'S START WITH THE WEB.
THE SHIFT TO MOBILE FOR THE WEB PLATFORM IS WELL UNDERWAY, WITH OVER -- WE'VE RECENTLY HIT A MILESTONE WITH
OVER A BILLION PEOPLE USING CHROME ON MOBILE EVERY MONTH.
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON SEVERAL INITIATIVES TO TRY AND MAKE THE WEBWORK BETTER ON MOBILE DEVICES. I WANT TO TALK
ABOUT TWO OF THEM. FIRST, WE'VE IMPLEMENTED POWERFUL NEW WEB STANDARDS IN CHROME THAT ENABLE A NEW
CLASS OF WEB SITE TO GAIN APP LIKE BEHAVIOR. LIKE WORKING
RELIABLY ON EVEN THE WORST NETWORKING CONNECTION OR SENDING NOTIFICATIONS TO RE-ENGAGE USERS.
WE CALL WEB SITES THAT USE THESE FEATURES PROGRESSIVE WEB APPS, BECAUSE THEY GET PROGRESSIVELY BETTER
DEPENDING ON THE CAPABILITY OF THE WEB BROWSERS, AND THEY CAN LEAD TO DRAMATICALLY BETTER USER EXPERIENCES.
SECOND, WE CREATED AN OPEN SOURCE PROJECT CALLED
ACCELERATED MOBILE PAGES OR AMP, TO MAKE IT SIMPLE TO CREATE EXTREMELY FAST MOBILE WEB SITES USING EXISTING WEB
STANDARDS. ON AVERAGE, AMP PAGES LOAD FOUR TIMES FASTER AND USE ONE-TENTH AS MUCH DATA.
THESE THINGS LOAD ALMOST INSTANTLY. SO WE'RE MAKING
IT EASIER TO DEVELOP MOBILE WEB SITES, BUT WE'RE ALSO INVESTING IN NATIVE DEVELOPMENT. WE WANT ANDROID
STUDIO TO BE THE QUICKEST, MOST RELIABLE WAY TO BUILD ANDROID APPS. I'D LIKE TO INVITE STEPH UP TO TELL YOU
MORE. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >>Stephanie Cuthbertson: THANKS, JASON. I'M STEPH. I
WORK ON THE ANDROID TEAM. ANDROID STUDIO IS OUR OFFICIAL IDE. IT'S PURPOSE-BUILT FOR ANDROID.
AND IT WAS ONLY THREE YEARS AGO, RIGHT HERE AT I/O, THAT WE SHOWED IT FOR THE FIRST TIME.
SINCE THEN, IT HAS BUILT A TON OF MOMENTUM.
92% OF THE TOP 125 APPS AND GAMES NOW USE ANDROID STUDIO.
AND MILLIONS OF DEVELOPERS WORLDWIDE. OUR ANDROID ENGINEERING TEAM SEES THAT ALMOST ALL THE
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPERS THAT WE CONNECT WITH HAVE USED IT AND SWITCHED OVER FROM OUR ECLIPSE TOOLS.
YOUR FEEDBACK HAS BEEN AWESOME BECAUSE IT'S HELPED US FOCUS ON THE RIGHT THINGS. WE CARE A LOT ABOUT MAKING IT
GREAT. AND THERE'S MUCH MORE TO COME. THIS MORNING, WE'LL RELEASE OUR LATEST, WHICH IS ANDROID
STUDIO'S 2.2 PREVIEW. FOCUSING ON SPEED, SMARTS,
AND ANDROID PLATFORM SUPPORT. FIRST, SPEED. ALREADY WITH 2.1 WE MADE BUILDING AND RUNNING CHANGES
10 TIMES FASTER THAN IT WAS ONLY SIX MONTHS AGO. OUR NEW INSTANT RUN FEATURE DROVE MOST OF THIS. NOW WHEN YOU
HIT "RUN" WE DEPLOY CHANGES DIRECTLY INTO THE RUNNING APP. THE EMULATORS ARE THREE TIMES FASTER AND PUSH SPEEDS
ARE EVEN FASTER THAN THAT. SO ALL OF THAT MEANS THE EMULATORS ARE NOW ACTUALLY FASTER THAN THE PHYSICAL
DEVICE THAT'S PROBABLY IN YOUR POCKET RIGHT NOW. BUT WE WANT TO KEEP SPEEDING YOU UP TO LAUNCH EARLIER.
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU TOLD US IS THAT WE COULD NOT POSSIBLY MAKE BUILD SPEEDS TOO FAST.
SO WITH 2.2 WE'RE GOING TO ACCELERATE BUILD SPEEDS AGAIN. PLUS WE KNOW INSTANT RUN'S A LONG-TERM BET SO
WE'LL KEEP EXPANDING COVERAGE. ANOTHER THING WE WANT TO DO IS MAKE IT EASIER TO WRITE TESTS TO HELP DRIVE UP APP QUALITY. SO WITH TEST
RECORDING, NOW AS YOU JUST TAP THROUGH YOUR APP, WE'LL RECORD -- WE'LL WRITE ALL OF YOUR ESPRESSO TEST CODE FOR
YOU. ALMOST -- IT'S BASICALLY AS IF -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
IT'S AS IF YOU HAD HANDWRITTEN THE CODE YOURSELF AND YOU CAN RUN THOSE TESTS LOCALLY OR YOU CAN RUN THEM
WITH OUR IDE-INTEGRATED CLOUD TEST LAB, TO MAKE SURE YOUR APP RUNS WELL ON MANY ANDROID DEVICES.
NOW, ONE OF THE THINGS THE ENGINEERING TEAM IS MOST EXCITED ABOUT IS THAT WITH 2.2 YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE
TO BUILD LAYOUTS FASTER AND THEY'LL RUN FASTER, TOO. SO LET ME SHOW YOU THIS. 2.2 INCLUDES A REWRITTEN
FEATURE-RICH LAYOUT DESIGNER, WITH NEW CONSTRAINT LAYOUTS. SO WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO SEE HERE IS YOU'LL BE ABLE TO USE
THE LAYOUT WINDOW. IT'S ALMOST LIKE A SHEET OF PAPER. SO YOU CAN POSITION YOUR WIDGETS AND ONCE YOU'RE HAPPY, YOU'LL SEE HERE WE SAVE YOU A TON OF TIME
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO AUTOMATICALLY ADD ALL THE CONSTRAINTS FOR YOU, DOING A BUNCH OF ACTUALLY VERY COOL
MATH UNDER THE COVERS. YOU'LL SEE THE UI HERE IS NOW GOING TO ADAPT SO YOU CAN TRY IT ON DIFFERENT ANDROID
ADVICES. IT WILL ADAPT TO DIFFERENT ORIENTATIONS. BUT WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE IS BEHIND THE SCENES YOUR APP WILL RUN
FASTER, TOO. SO MANY OF YOU HERE ARE PROFESSIONAL ANDROID DEVELOPERS AND YOU KNOW
BUILDING RICH UI USUALLY REQUIRES NESTED LAYOUTS AND THOSE ARE HARD TO PERFORMANCE-TUNE AT TIMES.
WITH CONSTRAINT LAYOUTS, THERE IS NO NESTING REQUIRED, SO OVERALL YOU GET THE SAME RICH UI, LESS WORK, AND
BETTER PERFORMANCE BY DEFAULT. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
SECOND, SMARTS. WE WANT TO HELP YOU WRITE BETTER ANDROID APPS. THE 2.2 PREVIEW INCLUDES A NEW APK ANALYZER
SO YOU CAN FIGURE OUT, "HEY, WHAT'S MAKING MY APP SO BIG?" THIS IS REALLY USEFUL FOR ALL OF YOU WHO ARE TARGETING
EMERGING MARKETS. YOU'VE TALKED TO US A LOT ABOUT THIS. YOU ALSO HAD ASKED FOR A LAYOUT INSPECTOR SO WE HAVE
A NEW LAYOUT INSPECTOR IN 2.2 SO YOU CAN FIND OUT WHAT'S INSIDE YOUR ANDROID LAYOUTS. WHEN YOU RUN CODE ANALYSES,
YOU'LL FIND A BUNCH OF NEW QUALITY CHECKS, AND THAT'S IN ADDITION TO THE 260 THAT ARE ALREADY THERE, ALL DESIGNED
TO ELIMINATE COMMON CLASSES OF ERRORS THAT WE SEE ON ANDROID. AND WE INTEGRATED THE LATEST
VERSION OF THE WONDERFUL INTELLIJ IDE, 2016.1.
[ APPLAUSE ] THE THIRD THING I WANT TO TALK ABOUT IS ANDROID PLATFORM SUPPORT. SO WE
DEVELOPED THE IDE RIGHT ALONGSIDE THE PLATFORM, SO WE CAN BRING YOU THE VERY BEST. 2.2 INCLUDES, TO NAME JUST A
FEW, SUPPORT FOR N'S NEW JACK COMPILER WHICH IS BRINGING YOU WONDERFUL JAVA 8 FEATURES LIKE LAMBDAS, DEFAULT
METHODS. AND FOR ALL OF YOU DEVELOPERS WHO ARE WORKINGGRAPHIC-RICH LIKE GAMES AND APPS, YOU KNOW C++
IS CRITICAL AND IT'S BECAUSE OF YOUR REQUESTS WE'VE BEEN SUBTLY BUILDING OUT C++ SUPPORT. NOW, WE ALREADY HAVE C++ EDITING AND DEBUGGING, BUT IN
2.2 YOU'LL FIND A MAJOR CHANGE BASED ON YOUR FEEDBACK. IN ADDITION TO GRADLE, FOR
BUILD WE'LL NOW SUPPORT CMAKE AND NDK BUILD. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] AND BOTH OF THOSE BUILD
SYSTEMS WILL WORK WITH THE DEBUGGER AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT, WE MADE C++ DEBUGGING BETTER ALSO.
SO I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT, WE WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE IT, IF YOU DOWNLOAD AND TRY ALL OF THIS TODAY AND GIVE US FEEDBACK. WITH THAT, I WOULD LOVE TO
PASS IT BACK TO JASON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >>Jason Titus: THANK YOU, ITSELF. IT'S GREAT TO SEE DROITS
ANDROIDS GETTING SO MUCH FASTER. 18 MONTHS AGO WE ACQUIRED FIREBASE, A GREAT MOBILE BACK END AS A SERVICE
FOR STORING YOUR APP'S DATA AND SYNCING IT ACROSS iOS, ANDROID AND THE WEB. SINCE THEN, ITS USAGE HAS
GROWN TO OVER 450,000 DEVELOPERS. WE WOULD REALLY ADMIRE, IT'S GREAT DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE
AND WE WANTED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BRING THAT TO OTHER AREAS OF APP DEVELOPMENT. WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY
WITH COMPANIES BIG AND SMALL ALL OVER THE WORLD TO EXPLORE HOW WE COULD MAKE OUR OFFERING BETTER.
TODAY, WE ARE ANNOUNCING THE NEXT GENERATION OF FIREBASE. FIREBASE IS -- [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE
] FIREBASE IS NOW A SUITE OF INTEGRATED PRODUCTS TO HELP YOU BUILD YOUR APP, GROW YOUR
USER BASE, AND EARN MONEY. THIS IS THE BIGGEST, MOST COMPREHENSIVE DEVELOPER UPDATE WE HAVE EVER MADE.
SO AT THE HEART OF THE NEW FIREBASE IS A MOBILE ANALYTICS TOOL WE'VE BUILT FROM THE GROUND UP CALLED
FIREBASE ANALYTICS. IT'S INSPIRED BY MUCH OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE IN THE LAST TEN YEARS WITH GOOGLE
ANALYTICS, BUT IT'S DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE UNIQUE NEEDS OF APPS. IT'S GREAT FOR APP DEVELOPERS
FOR A COUPLE OF WAYS. FIRST, IT GIVES YOU RICH INSIGHTS INTO WHAT USERS ARE DOING INSIDE OF YOUR APP. AND IT
ALSO TELLS YOU WHERE THEY'RE COMING FROM WITH RICH CROSS NETWORK ATTRIBUTION; ALL OF THIS IN A SINGLE DASHBOARD.
SECOND, WE'VE CREATED A NEW FEATURE CALLED FIREBASE AUDIENCES WHICH INTEGRATES ALL OF FIREBASE TOGETHER.
WITH FIREBASE AUDIENCES, YOU CAN GROUP USERS BASED ON THE CRITERIA THAT MATTERS TO YOU MOST, AND THEN TAKE ACTION
WITH NOTIFICATIONS, EXPERIMENTS, AND EVEN RE-ENGAGEMENT CAMPAIGNS ON ADWORDS.
AND THE BEST PART, FIREBASE ANALYTICS WORKS ACROSS ANDROID AND iOS AND IT IS COMPLETELY FREE AND
UNLIMITED! [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE
] SURROUNDING ANALYTICS ARE OVER A DOZEN OTHER MAJOR FEATURES. I'M GOING TO COVER
SOME HIGHLIGHTS. FIRST THERE'S CLOUD MESSAGING AND NOTIFICATIONS, WHICH IS BUILT ON THE WORLD'S MOST POPULAR CLOUD-TO-DEVICE MESSAGING PLATFORM, WITH OVER
ONE MILLION APPS SENDING OVER 170 BILLION MESSAGESES EVERY DAY. AND NOW THAT IT'S INTEGRATED
INTO FIREBASE, YOU CAN SEND TARGETED NOTIFICATIONS TO YOUR AUDIENCES WITHOUT WRITING ANY CODE. AND, LIKE
ANALYTICS, IT IS COMPLETELY FREE AND
UNLIMITED. [ APPLAUSE ] NOW, APP QUALITY IS IMPORTANT TO ALL OF US. IF YOUR APP
CRASHES, IT'S BAD FOR YOUR USERS, AND IT HURTS YOUR BUSINESS. WITHIN GOOGLE, TEAMS LIKE
CHROME BUILD AND DEPLOY ACROSS MULTIPLE PLATFORMS AT SCALE. SO WE'VE BUILT ON THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE AND
CREATED FIREBASE CRASH REPORTING. YOU CAN USE IT TO QUICKLY IDENTIFY BUGS AND ISSUES, AND
TAKE ACTION TO REDUCE IMPACT ON YOUR USERS.
ANOTHER ASPECT OF BUILDING A HIGH-QUALITY APP IS BEING ABLE TO TUNE AND EXPERIMENT WITH FEATURES. SO WE'VE
TAKEN THE SAME INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE USE FOR OUR OWN APPS AND CREATED FIREBASE REMOTE CONFIG WHICH LETS YOU CREATE
EXPERIMENTS AND TEST APP CONFIGURATIONS AT SCALE. FINALLY, TO HELP YOU GROW, WE'VE CREATED DYNAMIC LINKS.
A DYNAMIC DYNAMIC LINK IS JUST A REGULAR URL WHOSE BEHAVIOR CAN BE CONFIGURED DEPENDING
UPON WHERE IT'S TAPPED. IT PERSISTS THROUGH THE APP INSTALL PROCESS SO YOU CAN DRIVE INSTALLS WHILE STILL
MAINTAINING A SUPERIOR USER EXPERIENCE. IN THIS EXAMPLE WITH NPR, WITH DYNAMIC LINKS, WE WERE
ABLE TO TAKE WHAT WAS 13 TAPS DOWN TO ONLY
4. SO AS I MENTIONED, THERE ARE OVER A DOZEN FEATURES OF THE NEW FIREBASE, AND WHILE EACH
OF THEM IS INTERESTING ON ITS OWN, THE POWER OF FIREBASE IS IN HOW THEY'RE INTEGRATED TOGETHER.
HERE'S A QUICK EXAMPLE. FIRST, WITH CRASH REPORTING, YOU CAN SEE CRASHES AS THEY'RE HAPPENING. THEN IN
ANALYTICS, YOU CAN LOOK AT WHAT THE IMPACT IS ON YOUR BUSINESS. ONCE YOU FIX THE CRASH, YOU CAN ACTUALLY USE
NOTIFICATIONS TO REACH BACK OUT AND INVITE USERS BACK INTO YOUR APP. OR USE REMOTE CONFIG TO OFFER THEM A
COUPON. AND ALL OF THIS IS INTEGRATED INTO OUR GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM, SO THAT IF YOU WANT TO DO DEEPER, MORE
CUSTOMIZED ANALYSIS OF YOUR ANALYTICS DATA, YOU CAN EXPORT IT TO BIGQUERY, GOOGLE'S FULLY MANAGED,
PETABYTE SCALE DATA WHITE WAREHOUSE. SO I'VE ONLY SKIMMED THE SURFACE, BUT WE'RE GOING TO GO INTO DETAIL LATER ON THIS
AFTERNOON, AND WE HAVE OVER 30 SESSIONS ON FIREBASE THROUGHOUT I/O. THE NEW FIREBASE IS AVAILABLE
TODAY THROUGH ONE -- [ APPLAUSE ]
THROUGH ONE EASY TO INSTALL SDK ACROSS ANDROID, iOS,
AND THE WEB. PLEASE GIVE IT A TRY. WE'RE REALLY INTERESTED TO HEAR WHAT YOU THINK AND WE CAN'T WAIT TO
SEE WHAT YOU BUILD NEXT. AND WITH THAT, HERE IS ELLIE TO GIVE YOU A PREVIEW OF A NEW ANDROID EFFORT THAT WE'RE
WORKING ON FOR YOU. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ] >>Ellie Powers:
THANKS, JASON. HI, EVERYBODY. I'M ELLIE FROM THE ANDROID TEAM. AND I'M HERE WITH FICUS KIRKPATRICK, OUR ENGINEERING
DIRECTOR. WE HOPE THAT FIREBASE WILL MAKE IT A LOT EASIER FOR ALL OF YOU TO BUILD GREAT APPS.
AND WE'RE ALSO THINKING HARD ABOUT HOW ANDROID APPS SHOULD EVOLVE AND DO MORE. WE'LL BE SHOWING YOU A SNEAK
PEEK OF A NEW PROJECT. WE THINK IT'S GOING TO CHANGE HOW PEOPLE EXPERIENCE ANDROID APPS, AND WE'LL BE BRINGING
IT TO ANDROID USERS AND DEVELOPERS OVER THE NEXT YEAR. DEVELOPERS LIKE ALL OF YOU HERE HAVE BUILT AMAZING ANDROID APPS. THEY UNLEASH
THE FULL POWER OF ANDROID DEVICES, SEAMLESSLY COMBINING THE CAMERA, SENSORS, SMOOTH ANIMATIONS, AND MORE.
BUT YOU'VE REALLY TOLD US THAT YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO BRING USERS INTO YOUR APPS MORE QUICKLY. WE WANT TO
MAKE IT EASIER FOR USERS AND DEVELOPERS TO CONNECT; FOR USERS TO ACCESS A WIDER RANGE OF APPS AND FOR DEVELOPERS TO
REACH MORE PEOPLE. WITH THE WEB, YOU CAN JUST CLICK ON A LINK AND LAND ON A WEB PAGE. THAT'S ONE CLICK
AND A FEW SECONDS. WHAT IF YOU COULD RUN ANY APP WITH ONE TAP? THAT'S WHAT WE'RE WORKING ON.
WE'RE EVOLVING ANDROID APPS TO RUN INSTANTLY, WITHOUT INSTALLATION. WE CALL THIS ANDROID INSTANT APPS.
[ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE
] WE'RE GOING TO SHARE A QUICK PREVIEW OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON, AND I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS
MOMENT FOR A REALLY LONG TIME. SO LET'S SAY MY FRIEND MICHAEL SENDS ME THIS LINK TO
TASTY ON BUZZFEED VIDEO. AND LET'S BE COMPLETELY CLEAR. LET'S BE HONEST WITH EACH OTHER. I DO NOT HAVE THE
BUZZFEED VIDEO APP INSTALLED ON MY PHONE. SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IS WE'RE GOING TO TAP THE URL,
AND IT'S GOING TO TAKE ME RIGHT INTO BUZZFEED VIDEO'S ANDROID APP, WITHOUT INSTALLING
IT. FICUS, GO! WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE IS GOOGLE PLAY IS FETCHING ONLY
THE PIECES OF THE APP THAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW.
THERE. [ APPLAUSE
] WE ARE IN THE ANDROID APP. AND I DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO INSTALL IT. IT WAS PRETTY
FAST TOO; RIGHT? SO HERE YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT VIDEOS SHOWING HOW TO MAKE A BUNCH
OF DIFFERENT RECIPES, AND THE VIDEOS START PLAYING AUTOMATICALLY. REMEMBER, IT'S A REAL ANDROID APP; RIGHT? AND I CAN JUST SWIPE AND GO TO THE NEXT VIDEO
REALLY QUICKLY. THE APP WAS ABLE TO OPEN SO FAST BECAUSE IT'S BEEN SPLIT UP INTO MODULES. WHEN FICUS
TAPPED THE LINK, GOOGLE PLAY DOWNLOADED ONLY THE CODE THAT WAS NECESSARY TO DISPLAY THIS SCREEN.
AND IF I WANT TO KEEP BUZZFEED VIDEO ON MY HOME SCREEN, IT'S SIMPLE TO INSTALL THE APP RIGHT HERE.
HERE'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE.
PHOTO AND VIDEO HAS AN ANDROID APP BUT I DON'T HAVE IT ON MY PHONE BECAUSE I DON'T SHOP FOR CAMERAS EVERY
DAY. IF I'M SEARCHING FOR SOMETHING SPECIFIC LIKE A CAMERA BAG I CAN STILL GET THAT SAME EXPERIENCE. WITH
ONE TAP, THE APP OPENS UP RIGHT TO THE BAGGY WANT TO
BAG I WANT TO BUY. TECHNICALLY, THIS IS A DEEP LINK TO THE ANDROID ACTIVITY THAT B&H ROTE TO
DISPLAY THIS PAGE. I CAN ALSO SWIPE RIGHT HERE AND SEE MORE DETAILS ABOUT THE BAG.
NOW, WHEN I ADD IT TO MY CART, THE ANIMATION THERE WAS PRETTY SLICK. AND AT CHOWT
CHECKOUT TIME, DRAIP WORKS JUST LIKE IF I HAD THE APP INSTALLED. I DON'T HAVE TO PULL OUT MY CREDIT CARD AND TYPE IN MY NAME AND ADDRESS. AND DROID INSTANT APPS, ANDROID
INSTANT APPS I'M ALREADY SIGNED IN AND READY TO PAY. SO IT'S GOING TO TAKE ME TWO TAPS, NOT TWO MINUTES. FINALLY --
[ APPLAUSE ] FINALLY, LET'S SEE HOW
ANDROID INSTANT APPS CAN HELP ME WHEN I'M OUT AND ABOUT. SO I WALK UP TO A PARKING METER AND I NEED TO PAY. I'M
IN A REAL HURRY TODAY AND I DON'T HAVE TIME TO INSTALL A PARKING APP, BUT WHAT IF I COULD JUST TAP MY PHONE, AND
WITH NFC IT COULD BRING UP THE PARKING APP IMMEDIATELY? ALL I HAVE TO DO IS CHOOSE HOW LONG I WANT TO PARK. I'M
ALREADY DONE. AND NOW FICUS CAN RUN OFF THE STAGE TO HIS MEETING AND EVEN ADD MORE PARKING TIME LATER IF HE REALLY NEEDS TO. SO THAT'S ANDROID INSTANT
APPS. AS A USER, IT'S TOTALLY SEAMLESS, FROM LAUNCHING THE APP, TO SIGNING IN, TO MAKING PAYMENTS.
NOW, AS A DEVELOPER, YOU'LL UPDATE YOUR EXISTING APP. IT'S THE SAME ANDROID APIs, THE SAME PROJECT, AND THE
SAME SOURCE CODE. AND IT CAN TAKE LESS THAN A DAY OF WORK, DEPENDING ON HOW YOUR APP IS BUILT.
YOU'RE MODULARIZE YOUR APP AND GOOGLE PLAY WILL DOWNLOAD ONLY THE PARTS THAT ARE NEEDED ON THE FLY, AS YOU SAW
HERE. WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO GIVE DEVELOPERS MORE WAYS TO GET THEIR APPS INTO THE HANDS OF USERS. IN ADDITION
TO DISCOVERING YOUR APPS IN THE PLAY STORE AND INSTALLING THEM, INSTANT APPS WILL PROVIDE ANOTHER ONRAMP.
PEOPLE CAN CAN USE YOUR INSTANT APP DIRECTLY, AND AS WE SHOWED EARLIER, IF THEY WANT TO INSTALL IT, THAT'S EASY, TOO. MOST IMPORTANTLY, YOU WILL BE
IN CONTROL OF THE EXPERIENCES YOU BUILD. AND WHEN YOU DO MAKE THE UPDATE, YOUR APP WILL BE JUST ONE TAP AWAY FOR
OVER A BILLION PEOPLE. OH, YEAH, I ALMOST FORGOT TO
MENTION ONE REALLY IMPORTANT DETAIL. SO THIS DEMO THAT FICUS DID, HE ACTUALLY DID THAT ON A PHONE RUNNING
KITKAT. [ APPLAUSE
] YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT INSTANT APPS IS GOING TO BE COMPATIBLE ALL THE WAY BACK TO JELLY BEAN. AND WE REALLY WANT FOR ALL OF
YOU TO BE ABLE TO TRY THIS, AND WE'RE REALLY GOING TO MAKE IT AVAILABLE TO YOU JUST AS SOON AS WE CAN. BUT IT'S
A BIG CHANGE IN HOW WE THINK ABOUT APPS. WE WANT TO GET IT RIGHT. AND SO THAT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME FOR
US. WE'RE WORKING NOW WITH A SMALL SET OF DEVELOPERS AND WE'LL BE GRADUALLY ROLLING OUT ACCESS AND ACTUALLY ROLLING OUT INSTANT APPS TO
USERS LATER THIS YEAR. WE ARE SO EXCITED ABOUT ALL OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THIS WILL OPEN UP, AND WE
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO BUILD WHEN YOUR APP IS JUST A TAP AWAY. AND WITH THAT, I'LL HAND IT
BACK TO SUNDAR. [ CHEERS AND APPLAUSE ]
>>Sundar Pichai: THANK YOU, JASON AND ELLIE. FIREBASE IS
THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE RDEVELOPER OFFERING WE HAVE DONE TO DATE. I'M GLAD IT'S AVAILABLE TODAY AND LOOK
FORWARD TO HEARING YOUR FEEDBACK. WE TALKED A LOT TODAY ABOUT MACHINE LEARNING AND AI. WE
THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO ACCELERATE COMPUTING BY WORKING ON THIS WITH EVERYONE ELSE. AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO
DO THAT IN TWO WAYS. FIRST, WE ARE OPENING UP CORD
COMPONENTS OF OUR MACHINE LEARNING SYSTEMS. LAST YEAR, WE OPEN SOURCED TENSORFLOW SO DEVELOPERS CAN EMBED MACHINE
LEARNING AND DEEP NEURAL NETS WITH A SINGLE APIs API. IN
2015, IT WAS THE MOST FORKED PROJECT ON GITHUB, AND IT IS THE NUMBER ONE MACHINE LEARNING PROJECT ON THAT SITE.
LAST WEEK WE OPEN-SOURCED A NATURAL LANGUAGE PARSER WHICH IS ALSO BUILT ON TOP OF TENSORFLOW. WE ARE DOING
THESE THINGS SO WE CAN ENGAGE THE EXTERNAL COMMUNITY AND WORK ON THIS TOGETHER WITH EVERYONE.
SECOND, FOR DEVELOPERS AND COMPANIES OUT THERE, WE ARE ALSO EXPOSING OUR MACHINE LEARNING CAPABILITIES THROUGH
OUR GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM. WE ALREADY HAVE A CLOUD MACHINE LEARNING PLATFORM UNDERWAY, AND YOU GET ACCESS
TO COMPUTER VISION, SPEECH, LANGUAGE, AND TRANSLATION APIs. AND WE ARE WORKING ON BRINGING MANY MORE MACHINE
LEARNING APIs SO THAT YOU CAN GET ACCESS TO THE SAME GREAT CAPABILITIES WE HAVE INSIDE AT GOOGLE.
WE BELIEVE THIS WILL BE ONE OF THE BIGGEST DIFFERENTIATORS FOR THE GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM OVER TIME. AND, BY THE WAY, WHEN YOU USE GOOGLE CLOUD
PLATFORM, YOU NOT ONLY GET ACCESS TO THE GREAT SOFTWARE WE USE INTERNALLY, YOU GET ACCESS TO SPECIALIZED
HARDWARE WE BUILD INTERNALLY. AND TALKING ABOUT THAT, FOR MACHINE LEARNING, THE SCALE AT WHICH WE NEED TO DO
COMPUTING IS INCREDIBLE AND SO WE'VE STARTED BUILDING SPECIALIZED, CUSTOM HARDWARE. WE CALL THESE TENSOR
PROCESSING UNITS OR TPUs. TPUs DELIVER AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER PERFORMANCE PER WATT THAN ALL
COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE GPUs AND FPGAs. AND WHEN YOU USE THE GOOGLE CLOUD PLATFORM, YOU GET -- YOU CAN
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF TPUs AS WELL. TPUs ARE WHAT POWERED ALPHAGO, DEEPMIND'S ALPHAGO,
IN ITS GAME AGAINST LEE SEDOL SEDOL. GO IS AN ANCIENT
CHINESE BOARD GAME. IT'S A SIMPLE 19 BY 19 GRID BUT IT IS ONE OF THE MOST COMPLEX
GAMES HUMANS HAVE EVER DESIGNED. IT HAS MORE POSSIBLE BOARD CONFIGURATIONS, MANY MORE
POSSIBLE BOARD CONFIGURATIONS THAN THERE ARE ATOMS IN THE UNIVERSE. BEATING GO FOR COMPUTERS WAS WIDELY
CONSIDERED TO BE THE GRAND CHALLENGE FOR AI AND MOST PEOPLE THOUGHT IT WOULDN'T HAPPEN FOR ANOTHER DECADE OR
SO. SO WE ARE REALLY THRILLED THAT ALPHAGO WAS ABLE TO ACHIEVE THIS MILESTONE RECENTLY. ONE THING WORTH CALLING OUT,
IN THE SECOND GAME THERE WAS A MOVE 37 BY ALPHAGO. IT CHANGED THE COURSE OF THE GAME AND IS NOW WIDELY
CONSIDERED ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GO MOVES EVER SEEN IN TOURNAMENT PLAY. IT WAS NOT JUST AN INTUITIVE MOVE
BUT A VERY CREATIVE MOVE. WE NORMALLY DON'T ASSOCIATE COMPUTERS WITH MAKING CREATIVE CHOICES AND SO TO
US, THIS REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT IN AI. BY THE WAY, LEE SEDOL HAS WON
EVERY SINGLE GAME SINCE HE PLAYED AGAINST ALPHAGO AND HE HAS EVEN REPLAYED SOME OF THE MOVES HE LEARNED FROM ALPHAGO
IN THAT GAME. AS A STATE-OF-THE-ART CAPABILITIES IN MACHINE LEARNING AND AI PROGRESS, WE
SEE THEM BECOMING VERY VERSATILE AND WE THINK IT APPLIES TO A WIDE RANGE OF FIELDS. I WANT TO GIVE YOU
TWO EXAMPLES. FIRST, ROBOTICS. AT GOOGLE, A BUNCH OF 20%ERS DECIDED TO HELP ROBOTS -- TRAIN ROBOTS TO
PICK UP OBJECTS. YOU CAN SEE IT BEHIND ME. THIS IS NOT NEW. YOU USUALLY DO IT BY WRITING CONTROL SYSTEM CODE.
YOU PROGRAM THE ROBOTS WITH RULES. BUT THIS TIME THEY DECIDE TO USE DEEP LEARNING TECHNIQUES. SO YOU CREATE A
CONTINUOUS FEEDBACK CYCLE SO THAT THE ROBOTS CAN LEARN HAND-EYE COORDINATION BY THEMSELVES USING DEEP
LEARNING. AS YOU CAN SEE, THEY KEEP DOING IT AND THEY KEEP LEARNING IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND OVER TIME, THEY GET BETTER AND THEY EVEN LEARN
NATURAL AND USEFUL BEHAVIORS. SO, FOR EXAMPLE, THE ROBOT IS NUDGING THE STAPLER AWAY TO PICK UP THAT YELLOW OBJECT.
WE DIDN'T WRITE THAT RULE. THE ROBOT LEARNED IT AUTOMATICALLY USING DEEP LEARNING. SO IT'S AN AMAZING
EXAMPLE OF WHAT MACHINE LEARNING CAN DO. [ APPLAUSE ]
ANOTHER EXAMPLE IN HEALTHCARE, DIABETIC RETINOPATHY IS THE FASTEST GROWING CAUSE OF BLINDNESS.
IT AFFECTS 4.2 MILLION PEOPLE IN THE U.S. AND MANY MORE WORLDWIDE. TO DETECT IT, YOU NEED TO DO A SCAN, A SCAN OF
THE EYE LIKE YOU SEE BEHIND ME AND A HIGHLY TRAINED DOCTOR CAN DETECT IT. IF DETECTED EARLY, THE
TREATMENTS ARE EFFECTIVE. IF DETECTED LATE, IT CAUSES IRREVERSIBLE BLINDNESS. AND IT'S VERY, VERY DIFFICULT TO
HAVE HIGHLY TRAINED DOCTORS AVAILABLE IN MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD. SO WE SET OUT TO WORK WITH A SMALL TEAM OF
ENGINEERS AND DOCTORS AND, AGAIN, USE DEEP LEARNING AND STARTED TRAINING ON EYE SCANS. AND OVER TIME, OUR
COMPUTER VISION SYSTEMS HAVE GOTTEN REALLY GOOD AT DETECTING DIABETIC RETINOPATHY EARLY. THIS IS
STILL EARLY, AND THERE'S A LONG ROAD AHEAD, AND WE'LL WORK WITH THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY TO GET IT IN THE
HANDS OF AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. BUT YOU CAN SEE THE PROMISE, AGAIN, OF USING MACHINE LEARNING.
WHEN I HEAR ABOUT ADVANCEMENTS LIKE THESE, I'M REMINDED THAT WE LIVE IN AN EXTRAORDINARY PERIOD FOR
COMPUTING. WHETHER CLIMATE CHANGE, HEALTHCARE, OR
EDUCATION, THE MOST IMPORTANT STRUGGLES ALREADY HAVE THOUSANDS OF BRILLIANT AND DEDICATED PEOPLE WORKING TO
MAKE PROGRESS ON ISSUES THAT AFFECT EVERYONE. NOW, CONSIDER WHAT THE BEST CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCHERS,
DOCTORS, OR EDUCATORS CAN DO WITH THE POWER OF MACHINE
LEARNING ASSISTING THEM. AS YOU HAVE SEEN TODAY, I'M INCREDIBLY EXCITED ABOUT THE PROGRESS THAT WE ARE MAKING
WITH MACHINE LEARNING AND AI. WE BELIEVE THAT THE REAL TEST
IS WHETHER HUMANS CAN ACHIEVE A LOT MORE WITH THE SUPPORT OF AI ASSISTING THEM. THINGS PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT TO
BE IMPOSSIBLE MAY, IN FACT, BE POSSIBLE. WE LOOK FORWARD TO BUILDING THIS FUTURE TOGETHER WITH ALL OF YOU.
